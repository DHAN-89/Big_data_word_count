A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER. ALL EMOTIONS, AND THAT ONE PARTICULARLY, WERE ABHORRENT TO HIS COLD, PRECISE BUT ADMIRABLY BALANCED MIND. HE WAS, I TAKE IT, THE MOST PERFECT REASONING AND OBSERVING MACHINE THAT THE WORLD HAS SEEN, BUT AS A LOVER HE WOULD HAVE PLACED HIMSELF IN A FALSE POSITION. HE NEVER SPOKE OF THE SOFTER PASSIONS, SAVE WITH A GIBE AND A SNEER. THEY WERE ADMIRABLE THINGS FOR THE OBSERVER--EXCELLENT FOR DRAWING THE VEIL FROM MEN&#39;S MOTIVES AND ACTIONS. BUT FOR THE TRAINED REASONER TO ADMIT SUCH INTRUSIONS INTO HIS OWN DELICATE AND FINELY ADJUSTED TEMPERAMENT WAS TO INTRODUCE A DISTRACTING FACTOR WHICH MIGHT THROW A DOUBT UPON ALL HIS MENTAL RESULTS. GRIT IN A SENSITIVE INSTRUMENT, OR A CRACK IN ONE OF HIS OWN HIGH-POWER LENSES, WOULD NOT BE MORE DISTURBING THAN A STRONG EMOTION IN A NATURE SUCH AS HIS. AND YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I HAD SEEN LITTLE OF HOLMES LATELY. MY MARRIAGE HAD DRIFTED US AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. MY OWN COMPLETE HAPPINESS, AND THE HOME-CENTRED INTERESTS WHICH RISE UP AROUND THE MAN WHO FIRST FINDS HIMSELF MASTER OF HIS OWN ESTABLISHMENT, WERE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB ALL MY ATTENTION, WHILE HOLMES, WHO LOATHED EVERY FORM OF SOCIETY WITH HIS WHOLE BOHEMIAN SOUL, REMAINED IN OUR LODGINGS IN BAKER STREET, BURIED AMONG HIS OLD BOOKS, AND ALTERNATING FROM WEEK TO WEEK BETWEEN COCAINE AND AMBITION, THE DROWSINESS OF THE DRUG, AND THE FIERCE ENERGY OF HIS OWN KEEN NATURE. HE WAS STILL, AS EVER, DEEPLY ATTRACTED BY THE STUDY OF CRIME, AND OCCUPIED HIS IMMENSE FACULTIES AND EXTRAORDINARY POWERS OF OBSERVATION IN FOLLOWING OUT THOSE CLUES, AND CLEARING UP THOSE MYSTERIES WHICH HAD BEEN ABANDONED AS HOPELESS BY THE OFFICIAL POLICE. FROM TIME TO TIME I HEARD SOME VAGUE ACCOUNT OF HIS DOINGS: OF HIS SUMMONS TO ODESSA IN THE CASE OF THE TREPOFF MURDER, OF HIS CLEARING UP OF THE SINGULAR TRAGEDY OF THE ATKINSON BROTHERS AT TRINCOMALEE, AND FINALLY OF THE MISSION WHICH HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED SO DELICATELY AND SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE REIGNING FAMILY OF HOLLAND. BEYOND THESE SIGNS OF HIS ACTIVITY, HOWEVER, WHICH I MERELY SHARED WITH ALL THE READERS OF THE DAILY PRESS, I KNEW LITTLE OF MY FORMER FRIEND AND COMPANION.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;ONE NIGHT--IT WAS ON THE TWENTIETH OF MARCH, 1888--I WAS RETURNING FROM A JOURNEY TO A PATIENT (FOR I HAD NOW RETURNED TO CIVIL PRACTICE), WHEN MY WAY LED ME THROUGH BAKER STREET. AS I PASSED THE WELL-REMEMBERED DOOR, WHICH MUST ALWAYS BE ASSOCIATED IN MY MIND WITH MY WOOING, AND WITH THE DARK INCIDENTS OF THE STUDY IN SCARLET, I WAS SEIZED WITH A KEEN DESIRE TO SEE HOLMES AGAIN, AND TO KNOW HOW HE WAS EMPLOYING HIS EXTRAORDINARY POWERS. HIS ROOMS WERE BRILLIANTLY LIT, AND, EVEN AS I LOOKED UP, I SAW HIS TALL, SPARE FIGURE PASS TWICE IN A DARK SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE BLIND. HE WAS PACING THE ROOM SWIFTLY, EAGERLY, WITH HIS HEAD SUNK UPON HIS CHEST AND HIS HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HIM. TO ME, WHO KNEW HIS EVERY MOOD AND HABIT, HIS ATTITUDE AND MANNER TOLD THEIR OWN STORY. HE WAS AT WORK AGAIN. HE HAD RISEN OUT OF HIS DRUG-CREATED DREAMS AND WAS HOT UPON THE SCENT OF SOME NEW PROBLEM. I RANG THE BELL AND WAS SHOWN UP TO THE CHAMBER WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN IN PART MY OWN.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HIS MANNER WAS NOT EFFUSIVE. IT SELDOM WAS; BUT HE WAS GLAD, I THINK, TO SEE ME. WITH HARDLY A WORD SPOKEN, BUT WITH A KINDLY EYE, HE WAVED ME TO AN ARMCHAIR, THREW ACROSS HIS CASE OF CIGARS, AND INDICATED A SPIRIT CASE AND A GASOGENE IN THE CORNER. THEN HE STOOD BEFORE THE FIRE AND LOOKED ME OVER IN HIS SINGULAR INTROSPECTIVE FASHION.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WEDLOCK SUITS YOU,&#34; HE REMARKED. &#34;I THINK, WATSON, THAT YOU HAVE PUT ON SEVEN AND A HALF POUNDS SINCE I SAW YOU.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;SEVEN!&#34; I ANSWERED.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;INDEED, I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT A LITTLE MORE. JUST A TRIFLE MORE, I FANCY, WATSON. AND IN PRACTICE AGAIN, I OBSERVE. YOU DID NOT TELL ME THAT YOU INTENDED TO GO INTO HARNESS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN, HOW DO YOU KNOW?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I SEE IT, I DEDUCE IT. HOW DO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN GETTING YOURSELF VERY WET LATELY, AND THAT YOU HAVE A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;MY DEAR HOLMES,&#34; SAID I, &#34;THIS IS TOO MUCH. YOU WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN BURNED, HAD YOU LIVED A FEW CENTURIES AGO. IT IS TRUE THAT I HAD A COUNTRY WALK ON THURSDAY AND CAME HOME IN A DREADFUL MESS, BUT AS I HAVE CHANGED MY CLOTHES I CAN\\&#39;T IMAGINE HOW YOU DEDUCE IT. AS TO MARY JANE, SHE IS INCORRIGIBLE, AND MY WIFE HAS GIVEN HER NOTICE, BUT THERE, AGAIN, I FAIL TO SEE HOW YOU WORK IT OUT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HE CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF AND RUBBED HIS LONG, NERVOUS HANDS TOGETHER.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF,&#34; SAID HE; &#34;MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY. AS TO YOUR PRACTICE, IF A GENTLEMAN WALKS INTO MY ROOMS SMELLING OF IODOFORM, WITH A BLACK MARK OF NITRATE OF SILVER UPON HIS RIGHT FOREFINGER, AND A BULGE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS TOP-HAT TO SHOW WHERE HE HAS SECRETED HIS STETHOSCOPE, I MUST BE DULL, INDEED, IF I DO NOT PRONOUNCE HIM TO BE AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THE EASE WITH WHICH HE EXPLAINED HIS PROCESS OF DEDUCTION. &#34;WHEN I HEAR YOU GIVE YOUR REASONS,&#34; I REMARKED, &#34;THE THING ALWAYS APPEARS TO ME TO BE SO RIDICULOUSLY SIMPLE THAT I COULD EASILY DO IT MYSELF, THOUGH AT EACH SUCCESSIVE INSTANCE OF YOUR REASONING I AM BAFFLED UNTIL YOU EXPLAIN YOUR PROCESS. AND YET I BELIEVE THAT MY EYES ARE AS GOOD AS YOURS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;QUITE SO,&#34; HE ANSWERED, LIGHTING A CIGARETTE, AND THROWING HIMSELF DOWN INTO AN ARMCHAIR. &#34;YOU SEE, BUT YOU DO NOT OBSERVE. THE DISTINCTION IS CLEAR. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE FREQUENTLY SEEN THE STEPS WHICH LEAD UP FROM THE HALL TO THIS ROOM.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;FREQUENTLY.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;HOW OFTEN?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WELL, SOME HUNDREDS OF TIMES.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN HOW MANY ARE THERE?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;HOW MANY? I DON\\&#39;T KNOW.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;QUITE SO! YOU HAVE NOT OBSERVED. AND YET YOU HAVE SEEN. THAT IS JUST MY POINT. NOW, I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVENTEEN STEPS, BECAUSE I HAVE BOTH SEEN AND OBSERVED. BY THE WAY, SINCE YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THESE LITTLE PROBLEMS, AND SINCE YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO CHRONICLE ONE OR TWO OF MY TRIFLING EXPERIENCES, YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN THIS.&#34; HE THREW OVER A SHEET OF THICK, PINK-TINTED NOTEPAPER WHICH HAD BEEN LYING OPEN UPON THE TABLE. &#34;IT CAME BY THE LAST POST,&#34; SAID HE. &#34;READ IT ALOUD.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE NOTE WAS UNDATED, AND WITHOUT EITHER SIGNATURE OR ADDRESS.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THERE WILL CALL UPON YOU TO-NIGHT, AT A QUARTER TO EIGHT O\\&#39;CLOCK,&#34; IT SAID, &#34;A GENTLEMAN WHO DESIRES TO CONSULT YOU UPON A MATTER OF THE VERY DEEPEST MOMENT. YOUR RECENT SERVICES TO ONE OF THE ROYAL HOUSES OF EUROPE HAVE SHOWN THAT YOU ARE ONE WHO MAY SAFELY BE TRUSTED WITH MATTERS WHICH ARE OF AN IMPORTANCE WHICH CAN HARDLY BE EXAGGERATED. THIS ACCOUNT OF YOU WE HAVE FROM ALL QUARTERS RECEIVED. BE IN YOUR CHAMBER THEN AT THAT HOUR, AND DO NOT TAKE IT AMISS IF YOUR VISITOR WEAR A MASK.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THIS IS INDEED A MYSTERY,&#34; I REMARKED. &#34;WHAT DO YOU IMAGINE THAT IT MEANS?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I HAVE NO DATA YET. IT IS A CAPITAL MISTAKE TO THEORISE BEFORE ONE HAS DATA. INSENSIBLY ONE BEGINS TO TWIST FACTS TO SUIT THEORIES, INSTEAD OF THEORIES TO SUIT FACTS. BUT THE NOTE ITSELF. WHAT DO YOU DEDUCE FROM IT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE WRITING, AND THE PAPER UPON WHICH IT WAS WRITTEN.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THE MAN WHO WROTE IT WAS PRESUMABLY WELL TO DO,&#34; I REMARKED, ENDEAVOURING TO IMITATE MY COMPANION\\&#39;S PROCESSES. &#34;SUCH PAPER COULD NOT BE BOUGHT UNDER HALF A CROWN A PACKET. IT IS PECULIARLY STRONG AND STIFF.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;PECULIAR--THAT IS THE VERY WORD,&#34; SAID HOLMES. &#34;IT IS NOT AN ENGLISH PAPER AT ALL. HOLD IT UP TO THE LIGHT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I DID SO, AND SAW A LARGE &#34;E&#34; WITH A SMALL &#34;G,&#34; A &#34;P,&#34; AND A LARGE &#34;G&#34; WITH A SMALL &#34;T&#34; WOVEN INTO THE TEXTURE OF THE PAPER.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?&#34; ASKED HOLMES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THE NAME OF THE MAKER, NO DOUBT; OR HIS MONOGRAM, RATHER.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NOT AT ALL. THE \\&#39;G\\&#39; WITH THE SMALL \\&#39;T\\&#39; STANDS FOR \\&#39;GESELLSCHAFT,\\&#39; WHICH IS THE GERMAN FOR \\&#39;COMPANY.\\&#39; IT IS A CUSTOMARY CONTRACTION LIKE OUR \\&#39;CO.\\&#39; \\&#39;P,\\&#39; OF COURSE, STANDS FOR \\&#39;PAPIER.\\&#39; NOW FOR THE \\&#39;EG.\\&#39; LET US GLANCE AT OUR CONTINENTAL GAZETTEER.&#34; HE TOOK DOWN A HEAVY BROWN VOLUME FROM HIS SHELVES. &#34;EGLOW, EGLONITZ--HERE WE ARE, EGRIA. IT IS IN A GERMAN-SPEAKING COUNTRY--IN BOHEMIA, NOT FAR FROM CARLSBAD. \\&#39;REMARKABLE AS BEING THE SCENE OF THE DEATH OF WALLENSTEIN, AND FOR ITS NUMEROUS GLASS-FACTORIES AND PAPER-MILLS.\\&#39; HA, HA, MY BOY, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?&#34; HIS EYES SPARKLED, AND HE SENT UP A GREAT BLUE TRIUMPHANT CLOUD FROM HIS CIGARETTE.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THE PAPER WAS MADE IN BOHEMIA,&#34; I SAID.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;PRECISELY. AND THE MAN WHO WROTE THE NOTE IS A GERMAN. DO YOU NOTE THE PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION OF THE SENTENCE--\\&#39;THIS ACCOUNT OF YOU WE HAVE FROM ALL QUARTERS RECEIVED.\\&#39; A FRENCHMAN OR RUSSIAN COULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN THAT. IT IS THE GERMAN WHO IS SO UNCOURTEOUS TO HIS VERBS. IT ONLY REMAINS, THEREFORE, TO DISCOVER WHAT IS WANTED BY THIS GERMAN WHO WRITES UPON BOHEMIAN PAPER AND PREFERS WEARING A MASK TO SHOWING HIS FACE. AND HERE HE COMES, IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN, TO RESOLVE ALL OUR DOUBTS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS THE SHARP SOUND OF HORSES&#39; HOOFS AND GRATING WHEELS AGAINST THE CURB, FOLLOWED BY A SHARP PULL AT THE BELL. HOLMES WHISTLED.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;A PAIR, BY THE SOUND,&#34; SAID HE. &#34;YES,&#34; HE CONTINUED, GLANCING OUT OF THE WINDOW. &#34;A NICE LITTLE BROUGHAM AND A PAIR OF BEAUTIES. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY GUINEAS APIECE. THERE\\&#39;S MONEY IN THIS CASE, WATSON, IF THERE IS NOTHING ELSE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I THINK THAT I HAD BETTER GO, HOLMES.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NOT A BIT, DOCTOR. STAY WHERE YOU ARE. I AM LOST WITHOUT MY BOSWELL. AND THIS PROMISES TO BE INTERESTING. IT WOULD BE A PITY TO MISS IT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BUT YOUR CLIENT--&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NEVER MIND HIM. I MAY WANT YOUR HELP, AND SO MAY HE. HERE HE COMES. SIT DOWN IN THAT ARMCHAIR, DOCTOR, AND GIVE US YOUR BEST ATTENTION.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;A SLOW AND HEAVY STEP, WHICH HAD BEEN HEARD UPON THE STAIRS AND IN THE PASSAGE, PAUSED IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE DOOR. THEN THERE WAS A LOUD AND AUTHORITATIVE TAP.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;COME IN!&#34; SAID HOLMES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;A MAN ENTERED WHO COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN LESS THAN SIX FEET SIX INCHES IN HEIGHT, WITH THE CHEST AND LIMBS OF A HERCULES. HIS DRESS WAS RICH WITH A RICHNESS WHICH WOULD, IN ENGLAND, BE LOOKED UPON AS AKIN TO BAD TASTE. HEAVY BANDS OF ASTRAKHAN WERE SLASHED ACROSS THE SLEEVES AND FRONTS OF HIS DOUBLE-BREASTED COAT, WHILE THE DEEP BLUE CLOAK WHICH WAS THROWN OVER HIS SHOULDERS WAS LINED WITH FLAME-COLOURED SILK AND SECURED AT THE NECK WITH A BROOCH WHICH CONSISTED OF A SINGLE FLAMING BERYL. BOOTS WHICH EXTENDED HALFWAY UP HIS CALVES, AND WHICH WERE TRIMMED AT THE TOPS WITH RICH BROWN FUR, COMPLETED THE IMPRESSION OF BARBARIC OPULENCE WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY HIS WHOLE APPEARANCE. HE CARRIED A BROAD-BRIMMED HAT IN HIS HAND, WHILE HE WORE ACROSS THE UPPER PART OF HIS FACE, EXTENDING DOWN PAST THE CHEEKBONES, A BLACK VIZARD MASK, WHICH HE HAD APPARENTLY ADJUSTED THAT VERY MOMENT, FOR HIS HAND WAS STILL RAISED TO IT AS HE ENTERED. FROM THE LOWER PART OF THE FACE HE APPEARED TO BE A MAN OF STRONG CHARACTER, WITH A THICK, HANGING LIP, AND A LONG, STRAIGHT CHIN SUGGESTIVE OF RESOLUTION PUSHED TO THE LENGTH OF OBSTINACY.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU HAD MY NOTE?&#34; HE ASKED WITH A DEEP HARSH VOICE AND A STRONGLY MARKED GERMAN ACCENT. &#34;I TOLD YOU THAT I WOULD CALL.&#34; HE LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US, AS IF UNCERTAIN WHICH TO ADDRESS.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;PRAY TAKE A SEAT,&#34; SAID HOLMES. &#34;THIS IS MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE, DR. WATSON, WHO IS OCCASIONALLY GOOD ENOUGH TO HELP ME IN MY CASES. WHOM HAVE I THE HONOUR TO ADDRESS?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU MAY ADDRESS ME AS THE COUNT VON KRAMM, A BOHEMIAN NOBLEMAN. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS GENTLEMAN, YOUR FRIEND, IS A MAN OF HONOUR AND DISCRETION, WHOM I MAY TRUST WITH A MATTER OF THE MOST EXTREME IMPORTANCE. IF NOT, I SHOULD MUCH PREFER TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU ALONE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I ROSE TO GO, BUT HOLMES CAUGHT ME BY THE WRIST AND PUSHED ME BACK INTO MY CHAIR. &#34;IT IS BOTH, OR NONE,&#34; SAID HE. &#34;YOU MAY SAY BEFORE THIS GENTLEMAN ANYTHING WHICH YOU MAY SAY TO ME.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE COUNT SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS. &#34;THEN I MUST BEGIN,&#34; SAID HE, &#34;BY BINDING YOU BOTH TO ABSOLUTE SECRECY FOR TWO YEARS; AT THE END OF THAT TIME THE MATTER WILL BE OF NO IMPORTANCE. AT PRESENT IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT IT IS OF SUCH WEIGHT IT MAY HAVE AN INFLUENCE UPON EUROPEAN HISTORY.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I PROMISE,&#34; SAID HOLMES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND I.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU WILL EXCUSE THIS MASK,&#34; CONTINUED OUR STRANGE VISITOR. &#34;THE AUGUST PERSON WHO EMPLOYS ME WISHES HIS AGENT TO BE UNKNOWN TO YOU, AND I MAY CONFESS AT ONCE THAT THE TITLE BY WHICH I HAVE JUST CALLED MYSELF IS NOT EXACTLY MY OWN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I WAS AWARE OF IT,&#34; SAID HOLMES DRYLY.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE OF GREAT DELICACY, AND EVERY PRECAUTION HAS TO BE TAKEN TO QUENCH WHAT MIGHT GROW TO BE AN IMMENSE SCANDAL AND SERIOUSLY COMPROMISE ONE OF THE REIGNING FAMILIES OF EUROPE. TO SPEAK PLAINLY, THE MATTER IMPLICATES THE GREAT HOUSE OF ORMSTEIN, HEREDITARY KINGS OF BOHEMIA.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I WAS ALSO AWARE OF THAT,&#34; MURMURED HOLMES, SETTLING HIMSELF DOWN IN HIS ARMCHAIR AND CLOSING HIS EYES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;OUR VISITOR GLANCED WITH SOME APPARENT SURPRISE AT THE LANGUID, LOUNGING FIGURE OF THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN NO DOUBT DEPICTED TO HIM AS THE MOST INCISIVE REASONER AND MOST ENERGETIC AGENT IN EUROPE. HOLMES SLOWLY REOPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED IMPATIENTLY AT HIS GIGANTIC CLIENT.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IF YOUR MAJESTY WOULD CONDESCEND TO STATE YOUR CASE,&#34; HE REMARKED, &#34;I SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO ADVISE YOU.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE MAN SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION. THEN, WITH A GESTURE OF DESPERATION, HE TORE THE MASK FROM HIS FACE AND HURLED IT UPON THE GROUND. &#34;YOU ARE RIGHT,&#34; HE CRIED; &#34;I AM THE KING. WHY SHOULD I ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL IT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHY, INDEED?&#34; MURMURED HOLMES. &#34;YOUR MAJESTY HAD NOT SPOKEN BEFORE I WAS AWARE THAT I WAS ADDRESSING WILHELM GOTTSREICH SIGISMOND VON ORMSTEIN, GRAND DUKE OF CASSEL-FELSTEIN, AND HEREDITARY KING OF BOHEMIA.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND,&#34; SAID OUR STRANGE VISITOR, SITTING DOWN ONCE MORE AND PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS HIGH WHITE FOREHEAD, &#34;YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DOING SUCH BUSINESS IN MY OWN PERSON. YET THE MATTER WAS SO DELICATE THAT I COULD NOT CONFIDE IT TO AN AGENT WITHOUT PUTTING MYSELF IN HIS POWER. I HAVE COME INCOGNITO FROM PRAGUE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSULTING YOU.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN, PRAY CONSULT,&#34; SAID HOLMES, SHUTTING HIS EYES ONCE MORE.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THE FACTS ARE BRIEFLY THESE: SOME FIVE YEARS AGO, DURING A LENGTHY VISIT TO WARSAW, I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE WELL-KNOWN ADVENTURESS, IRENE ADLER. THE NAME IS NO DOUBT FAMILIAR TO YOU.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;KINDLY LOOK HER UP IN MY INDEX, DOCTOR,&#34; MURMURED HOLMES WITHOUT OPENING HIS EYES. FOR MANY YEARS HE HAD ADOPTED A SYSTEM OF DOCKETING ALL PARAGRAPHS CONCERNING MEN AND THINGS, SO THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO NAME A SUBJECT OR A PERSON ON WHICH HE COULD NOT AT ONCE FURNISH INFORMATION. IN THIS CASE I FOUND HER BIOGRAPHY SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN THAT OF A HEBREW RABBI AND THAT OF A STAFF-COMMANDER WHO HAD WRITTEN A MONOGRAPH UPON THE DEEP-SEA FISHES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;LET ME SEE!&#34; SAID HOLMES. &#34;HUM! BORN IN NEW JERSEY IN THE YEAR 1858. CONTRALTO--HUM! LA SCALA, HUM! PRIMA DONNA IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW--YES! RETIRED FROM OPERATIC STAGE--HA! LIVING IN LONDON--QUITE SO! YOUR MAJESTY, AS I UNDERSTAND, BECAME ENTANGLED WITH THIS YOUNG PERSON, WROTE HER SOME COMPROMISING LETTERS, AND IS NOW DESIROUS OF GETTING THOSE LETTERS BACK.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;PRECISELY SO. BUT HOW--&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WAS THERE A SECRET MARRIAGE?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NONE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NO LEGAL PAPERS OR CERTIFICATES?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NONE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN I FAIL TO FOLLOW YOUR MAJESTY. IF THIS YOUNG PERSON SHOULD PRODUCE HER LETTERS FOR BLACKMAILING OR OTHER PURPOSES, HOW IS SHE TO PROVE THEIR AUTHENTICITY?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THERE IS THE WRITING.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;POOH, POOH! FORGERY.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;MY PRIVATE NOTE-PAPER.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;STOLEN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;MY OWN SEAL.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IMITATED.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;MY PHOTOGRAPH.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BOUGHT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WE WERE BOTH IN THE PHOTOGRAPH.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;OH, DEAR! THAT IS VERY BAD! YOUR MAJESTY HAS INDEED COMMITTED AN INDISCRETION.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I WAS MAD--INSANE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU HAVE COMPROMISED YOURSELF SERIOUSLY.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I WAS ONLY CROWN PRINCE THEN. I WAS YOUNG. I AM BUT THIRTY NOW.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT MUST BE RECOVERED.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WE HAVE TRIED AND FAILED.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOUR MAJESTY MUST PAY. IT MUST BE BOUGHT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;SHE WILL NOT SELL.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;STOLEN, THEN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;FIVE ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE. TWICE BURGLARS IN MY PAY RANSACKED HER HOUSE. ONCE WE DIVERTED HER LUGGAGE WHEN SHE TRAVELLED. TWICE SHE HAS BEEN WAYLAID. THERE HAS BEEN NO RESULT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NO SIGN OF IT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;ABSOLUTELY NONE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HOLMES LAUGHED. &#34;IT IS QUITE A PRETTY LITTLE PROBLEM,&#34; SAID HE.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BUT A VERY SERIOUS ONE TO ME,&#34; RETURNED THE KING REPROACHFULLY.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;VERY, INDEED. AND WHAT DOES SHE PROPOSE TO DO WITH THE PHOTOGRAPH?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;TO RUIN ME.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BUT HOW?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I AM ABOUT TO BE MARRIED.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;SO I HAVE HEARD.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;TO CLOTILDE LOTHMAN VON SAXE-MENINGEN, SECOND DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA. YOU MAY KNOW THE STRICT PRINCIPLES OF HER FAMILY. SHE IS HERSELF THE VERY SOUL OF DELICACY. A SHADOW OF A DOUBT AS TO MY CONDUCT WOULD BRING THE MATTER TO AN END.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND IRENE ADLER?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THREATENS TO SEND THEM THE PHOTOGRAPH. AND SHE WILL DO IT. I KNOW THAT SHE WILL DO IT. YOU DO NOT KNOW HER, BUT SHE HAS A SOUL OF STEEL. SHE HAS THE FACE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF WOMEN, AND THE MIND OF THE MOST RESOLUTE OF MEN. RATHER THAN I SHOULD MARRY ANOTHER WOMAN, THERE ARE NO LENGTHS TO WHICH SHE WOULD NOT GO--NONE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU ARE SURE THAT SHE HAS NOT SENT IT YET?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I AM SURE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND WHY?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BECAUSE SHE HAS SAID THAT SHE WOULD SEND IT ON THE DAY WHEN THE BETROTHAL WAS PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED. THAT WILL BE NEXT MONDAY.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;OH, THEN WE HAVE THREE DAYS YET,&#34; SAID HOLMES WITH A YAWN. &#34;THAT IS VERY FORTUNATE, AS I HAVE ONE OR TWO MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE TO LOOK INTO JUST AT PRESENT. YOUR MAJESTY WILL, OF COURSE, STAY IN LONDON FOR THE PRESENT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;CERTAINLY. YOU WILL FIND ME AT THE LANGHAM UNDER THE NAME OF THE COUNT VON KRAMM.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN I SHALL DROP YOU A LINE TO LET YOU KNOW HOW WE PROGRESS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;PRAY DO SO. I SHALL BE ALL ANXIETY.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN, AS TO MONEY?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU HAVE CARTE BLANCHE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;ABSOLUTELY?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I TELL YOU THAT I WOULD GIVE ONE OF THE PROVINCES OF MY KINGDOM TO HAVE THAT PHOTOGRAPH.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND FOR PRESENT EXPENSES?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE KING TOOK A HEAVY CHAMOIS LEATHER BAG FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK AND LAID IT ON THE TABLE.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN GOLD AND SEVEN HUNDRED IN NOTES,&#34; HE SAID.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HOLMES SCRIBBLED A RECEIPT UPON A SHEET OF HIS NOTE-BOOK AND HANDED IT TO HIM.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND MADEMOISELLE\\&#39;S ADDRESS?&#34; HE ASKED.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IS BRIONY LODGE, SERPENTINE AVENUE, ST. JOHN\\&#39;S WOOD.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HOLMES TOOK A NOTE OF IT. &#34;ONE OTHER QUESTION,&#34; SAID HE. &#34;WAS THE PHOTOGRAPH A CABINET?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT WAS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN, GOOD-NIGHT, YOUR MAJESTY, AND I TRUST THAT WE SHALL SOON HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. AND GOOD-NIGHT, WATSON,&#34; HE ADDED, AS THE WHEELS OF THE ROYAL BROUGHAM ROLLED DOWN THE STREET. &#34;IF YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO CALL TO-MORROW AFTERNOON AT THREE O\\&#39;CLOCK I SHOULD LIKE TO CHAT THIS LITTLE MATTER OVER WITH YOU.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;II.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;AT THREE O&#39;CLOCK PRECISELY I WAS AT BAKER STREET, BUT HOLMES HAD NOT YET RETURNED. THE LANDLADY INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD LEFT THE HOUSE SHORTLY AFTER EIGHT O&#39;CLOCK IN THE MORNING. I SAT DOWN BESIDE THE FIRE, HOWEVER, WITH THE INTENTION OF AWAITING HIM, HOWEVER LONG HE MIGHT BE. I WAS ALREADY DEEPLY INTERESTED IN HIS INQUIRY, FOR, THOUGH IT WAS SURROUNDED BY NONE OF THE GRIM AND STRANGE FEATURES WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TWO CRIMES WHICH I HAVE ALREADY RECORDED, STILL, THE NATURE OF THE CASE AND THE EXALTED STATION OF HIS CLIENT GAVE IT A CHARACTER OF ITS OWN. INDEED, APART FROM THE NATURE OF THE INVESTIGATION WHICH MY FRIEND HAD ON HAND, THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS MASTERLY GRASP OF A SITUATION, AND HIS KEEN, INCISIVE REASONING, WHICH MADE IT A PLEASURE TO ME TO STUDY HIS SYSTEM OF WORK, AND TO FOLLOW THE QUICK, SUBTLE METHODS BY WHICH HE DISENTANGLED THE MOST INEXTRICABLE MYSTERIES. SO ACCUSTOMED WAS I TO HIS INVARIABLE SUCCESS THAT THE VERY POSSIBILITY OF HIS FAILING HAD CEASED TO ENTER INTO MY HEAD.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;IT WAS CLOSE UPON FOUR BEFORE THE DOOR OPENED, AND A DRUNKEN-LOOKING GROOM, ILL-KEMPT AND SIDE-WHISKERED, WITH AN INFLAMED FACE AND DISREPUTABLE CLOTHES, WALKED INTO THE ROOM. ACCUSTOMED AS I WAS TO MY FRIEND&#39;S AMAZING POWERS IN THE USE OF DISGUISES, I HAD TO LOOK THREE TIMES BEFORE I WAS CERTAIN THAT IT WAS INDEED HE. WITH A NOD HE VANISHED INTO THE BEDROOM, WHENCE HE EMERGED IN FIVE MINUTES TWEED-SUITED AND RESPECTABLE, AS OF OLD. PUTTING HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS, HE STRETCHED OUT HIS LEGS IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND LAUGHED HEARTILY FOR SOME MINUTES.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WELL, REALLY!&#34; HE CRIED, AND THEN HE CHOKED AND LAUGHED AGAIN UNTIL HE WAS OBLIGED TO LIE BACK, LIMP AND HELPLESS, IN THE CHAIR.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHAT IS IT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT\\&#39;S QUITE TOO FUNNY. I AM SURE YOU COULD NEVER GUESS HOW I EMPLOYED MY MORNING, OR WHAT I ENDED BY DOING.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I CAN\\&#39;T IMAGINE. I SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE HABITS, AND PERHAPS THE HOUSE, OF MISS IRENE ADLER.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;QUITE SO; BUT THE SEQUEL WAS RATHER UNUSUAL. I WILL TELL YOU, HOWEVER. I LEFT THE HOUSE A LITTLE AFTER EIGHT O\\&#39;CLOCK THIS MORNING IN THE CHARACTER OF A GROOM OUT OF WORK. THERE IS A WONDERFUL SYMPATHY AND FREEMASONRY AMONG HORSEY MEN. BE ONE OF THEM, AND YOU WILL KNOW ALL THAT THERE IS TO KNOW. I SOON FOUND BRIONY LODGE. IT IS A BIJOU VILLA, WITH A GARDEN AT THE BACK, BUT BUILT OUT IN FRONT RIGHT UP TO THE ROAD, TWO STORIES. CHUBB LOCK TO THE DOOR. LARGE SITTING-ROOM ON THE RIGHT SIDE, WELL FURNISHED, WITH LONG WINDOWS ALMOST TO THE FLOOR, AND THOSE PREPOSTEROUS ENGLISH WINDOW FASTENERS WHICH A CHILD COULD OPEN. BEHIND THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE, SAVE THAT THE PASSAGE WINDOW COULD BE REACHED FROM THE TOP OF THE COACH-HOUSE. I WALKED ROUND IT AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW, BUT WITHOUT NOTING ANYTHING ELSE OF INTEREST.&#39;,\n\n*** WARNING: skipped 46492 bytes of output ***\n\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;EIGHT WEEKS PASSED AWAY LIKE THIS, AND I HAD WRITTEN ABOUT ABBOTS AND ARCHERY AND ARMOUR AND ARCHITECTURE AND ATTICA, AND HOPED WITH DILIGENCE THAT I MIGHT GET ON TO THE B\\&#39;S BEFORE VERY LONG. IT COST ME SOMETHING IN FOOLSCAP, AND I HAD PRETTY NEARLY FILLED A SHELF WITH MY WRITINGS. AND THEN SUDDENLY THE WHOLE BUSINESS CAME TO AN END.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;TO AN END?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YES, SIR. AND NO LATER THAN THIS MORNING. I WENT TO MY WORK AS USUAL AT TEN O\\&#39;CLOCK, BUT THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND LOCKED, WITH A LITTLE SQUARE OF CARDBOARD HAMMERED ON TO THE MIDDLE OF THE PANEL WITH A TACK. HERE IT IS, AND YOU CAN READ FOR YOURSELF.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HE HELD UP A PIECE OF WHITE CARDBOARD ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHEET OF NOTE-PAPER. IT READ IN THIS FASHION:&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;IS&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;DISSOLVED.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;OCTOBER 9, 1890.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I SURVEYED THIS CURT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE RUEFUL FACE BEHIND IT, UNTIL THE COMICAL SIDE OF THE AFFAIR SO COMPLETELY OVERTOPPED EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION THAT WE BOTH BURST OUT INTO A ROAR OF LAUGHTER.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I CANNOT SEE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING VERY FUNNY,&#34; CRIED OUR CLIENT, FLUSHING UP TO THE ROOTS OF HIS FLAMING HEAD. &#34;IF YOU CAN DO NOTHING BETTER THAN LAUGH AT ME, I CAN GO ELSEWHERE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NO, NO,&#34; CRIED HOLMES, SHOVING HIM BACK INTO THE CHAIR FROM WHICH HE HAD HALF RISEN. &#34;I REALLY WOULDN\\&#39;T MISS YOUR CASE FOR THE WORLD. IT IS MOST REFRESHINGLY UNUSUAL. BUT THERE IS, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE MY SAYING SO, SOMETHING JUST A LITTLE FUNNY ABOUT IT. PRAY WHAT STEPS DID YOU TAKE WHEN YOU FOUND THE CARD UPON THE DOOR?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I WAS STAGGERED, SIR. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. THEN I CALLED AT THE OFFICES ROUND, BUT NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. FINALLY, I WENT TO THE LANDLORD, WHO IS AN ACCOUNTANT LIVING ON THE GROUND FLOOR, AND I ASKED HIM IF HE COULD TELL ME WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE. HE SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANY SUCH BODY. THEN I ASKED HIM WHO MR. DUNCAN ROSS WAS. HE ANSWERED THAT THE NAME WAS NEW TO HIM.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34; \\&#39;WELL,\\&#39; SAID I, \\&#39;THE GENTLEMAN AT NO. 4.\\&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34; \\&#39;WHAT, THE RED-HEADED MAN?\\&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34; \\&#39;YES.\\&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34; \\&#39;OH,\\&#39; SAID HE, \\&#39;HIS NAME WAS WILLIAM MORRIS. HE WAS A SOLICITOR AND WAS USING MY ROOM AS A TEMPORARY CONVENIENCE UNTIL HIS NEW PREMISES WERE READY. HE MOVED OUT YESTERDAY.\\&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34; \\&#39;WHERE COULD I FIND HIM?\\&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34; \\&#39;OH, AT HIS NEW OFFICES. HE DID TELL ME THE ADDRESS. YES, 17 KING EDWARD STREET, NEAR ST. PAUL\\&#39;S.\\&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I STARTED OFF, MR. HOLMES, BUT WHEN I GOT TO THAT ADDRESS IT WAS A MANUFACTORY OF ARTIFICIAL KNEE-CAPS, AND NO ONE IN IT HAD EVER HEARD OF EITHER MR. WILLIAM MORRIS OR MR. DUNCAN ROSS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND WHAT DID YOU DO THEN?&#34; ASKED HOLMES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I WENT HOME TO SAXE-COBURG SQUARE, AND I TOOK THE ADVICE OF MY ASSISTANT. BUT HE COULD NOT HELP ME IN ANY WAY. HE COULD ONLY SAY THAT IF I WAITED I SHOULD HEAR BY POST. BUT THAT WAS NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH, MR. HOLMES. I DID NOT WISH TO LOSE SUCH A PLACE WITHOUT A STRUGGLE, SO, AS I HAD HEARD THAT YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE ADVICE TO POOR FOLK WHO WERE IN NEED OF IT, I CAME RIGHT AWAY TO YOU.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND YOU DID VERY WISELY,&#34; SAID HOLMES. &#34;YOUR CASE IS AN EXCEEDINGLY REMARKABLE ONE, AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IT. FROM WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME I THINK THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT GRAVER ISSUES HANG FROM IT THAN MIGHT AT FIRST SIGHT APPEAR.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;GRAVE ENOUGH!&#34; SAID MR. JABEZ WILSON. &#34;WHY, I HAVE LOST FOUR POUND A WEEK.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AS FAR AS YOU ARE PERSONALLY CONCERNED,&#34; REMARKED HOLMES, &#34;I DO NOT SEE THAT YOU HAVE ANY GRIEVANCE AGAINST THIS EXTRAORDINARY LEAGUE. ON THE CONTRARY, YOU ARE, AS I UNDERSTAND, RICHER BY SOME $30, TO SAY NOTHING OF THE MINUTE KNOWLEDGE WHICH YOU HAVE GAINED ON EVERY SUBJECT WHICH COMES UNDER THE LETTER A. YOU HAVE LOST NOTHING BY THEM.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NO, SIR. BUT I WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT THEM, AND WHO THEY ARE, AND WHAT THEIR OBJECT WAS IN PLAYING THIS PRANK--IF IT WAS A PRANK--UPON ME. IT WAS A PRETTY EXPENSIVE JOKE FOR THEM, FOR IT COST THEM TWO AND THIRTY POUNDS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WE SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO CLEAR UP THESE POINTS FOR YOU. AND, FIRST, ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS, MR. WILSON. THIS ASSISTANT OF YOURS WHO FIRST CALLED YOUR ATTENTION TO THE ADVERTISEMENT--HOW LONG HAD HE BEEN WITH YOU?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;ABOUT A MONTH THEN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;HOW DID HE COME?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IN ANSWER TO AN ADVERTISEMENT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WAS HE THE ONLY APPLICANT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NO, I HAD A DOZEN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHY DID YOU PICK HIM?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BECAUSE HE WAS HANDY AND WOULD COME CHEAP.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AT HALF WAGES, IN FACT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YES.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHAT IS HE LIKE, THIS VINCENT SPAULDING?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;SMALL, STOUT-BUILT, VERY QUICK IN HIS WAYS, NO HAIR ON HIS FACE, THOUGH HE\\&#39;S NOT SHORT OF THIRTY. HAS A WHITE SPLASH OF ACID UPON HIS FOREHEAD.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HOLMES SAT UP IN HIS CHAIR IN CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT. &#34;I THOUGHT AS MUCH,&#34; SAID HE. &#34;HAVE YOU EVER OBSERVED THAT HIS EARS ARE PIERCED FOR EARRINGS?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YES, SIR. HE TOLD ME THAT A GIPSY HAD DONE IT FOR HIM WHEN HE WAS A LAD.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;HUM!&#34; SAID HOLMES, SINKING BACK IN DEEP THOUGHT. &#34;HE IS STILL WITH YOU?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;OH, YES, SIR; I HAVE ONLY JUST LEFT HIM.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND HAS YOUR BUSINESS BEEN ATTENDED TO IN YOUR ABSENCE?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF, SIR. THERE\\&#39;S NEVER VERY MUCH TO DO OF A MORNING.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THAT WILL DO, MR. WILSON. I SHALL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU AN OPINION UPON THE SUBJECT IN THE COURSE OF A DAY OR TWO. TO-DAY IS SATURDAY, AND I HOPE THAT BY MONDAY WE MAY COME TO A CONCLUSION.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WELL, WATSON,&#34; SAID HOLMES WHEN OUR VISITOR HAD LEFT US, &#34;WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT ALL?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I MAKE NOTHING OF IT,&#34; I ANSWERED FRANKLY. &#34;IT IS A MOST MYSTERIOUS BUSINESS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AS A RULE,&#34; SAID HOLMES, &#34;THE MORE BIZARRE A THING IS THE LESS MYSTERIOUS IT PROVES TO BE. IT IS YOUR COMMONPLACE, FEATURELESS CRIMES WHICH ARE REALLY PUZZLING, JUST AS A COMMONPLACE FACE IS THE MOST DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY. BUT I MUST BE PROMPT OVER THIS MATTER.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, THEN?&#34; I ASKED.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;TO SMOKE,&#34; HE ANSWERED. &#34;IT IS QUITE A THREE PIPE PROBLEM, AND I BEG THAT YOU WON\\&#39;T SPEAK TO ME FOR FIFTY MINUTES.&#34; HE CURLED HIMSELF UP IN HIS CHAIR, WITH HIS THIN KNEES DRAWN UP TO HIS HAWK-LIKE NOSE, AND THERE HE SAT WITH HIS EYES CLOSED AND HIS BLACK CLAY PIPE THRUSTING OUT LIKE THE BILL OF SOME STRANGE BIRD. I HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE HAD DROPPED ASLEEP, AND INDEED WAS NODDING MYSELF, WHEN HE SUDDENLY SPRANG OUT OF HIS CHAIR WITH THE GESTURE OF A MAN WHO HAS MADE UP HIS MIND AND PUT HIS PIPE DOWN UPON THE MANTELPIECE.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;SARASATE PLAYS AT THE ST. JAMES\\&#39;S HALL THIS AFTERNOON,&#34; HE REMARKED. &#34;WHAT DO YOU THINK, WATSON? COULD YOUR PATIENTS SPARE YOU FOR A FEW HOURS?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I HAVE NOTHING TO DO TO-DAY. MY PRACTICE IS NEVER VERY ABSORBING.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN PUT ON YOUR HAT AND COME. I AM GOING THROUGH THE CITY FIRST, AND WE CAN HAVE SOME LUNCH ON THE WAY. I OBSERVE THAT THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF GERMAN MUSIC ON THE PROGRAMME, WHICH IS RATHER MORE TO MY TASTE THAN ITALIAN OR FRENCH. IT IS INTROSPECTIVE, AND I WANT TO INTROSPECT. COME ALONG!&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;WE TRAVELLED BY THE UNDERGROUND AS FAR AS ALDERSGATE; AND A SHORT WALK TOOK US TO SAXE-COBURG SQUARE, THE SCENE OF THE SINGULAR STORY WHICH WE HAD LISTENED TO IN THE MORNING. IT WAS A POKY, LITTLE, SHABBY-GENTEEL PLACE, WHERE FOUR LINES OF DINGY TWO-STORIED BRICK HOUSES LOOKED OUT INTO A SMALL RAILED-IN ENCLOSURE, WHERE A LAWN OF WEEDY GRASS AND A FEW CLUMPS OF FADED LAUREL BUSHES MADE A HARD FIGHT AGAINST A SMOKE-LADEN AND UNCONGENIAL ATMOSPHERE. THREE GILT BALLS AND A BROWN BOARD WITH &#34;JABEZ WILSON&#34; IN WHITE LETTERS, UPON A CORNER HOUSE, ANNOUNCED THE PLACE WHERE OUR RED-HEADED CLIENT CARRIED ON HIS BUSINESS. SHERLOCK HOLMES STOPPED IN FRONT OF IT WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND LOOKED IT ALL OVER, WITH HIS EYES SHINING BRIGHTLY BETWEEN PUCKERED LIDS. THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY UP THE STREET, AND THEN DOWN AGAIN TO THE CORNER, STILL LOOKING KEENLY AT THE HOUSES. FINALLY HE RETURNED TO THE PAWNBROKER\\&#39;S, AND, HAVING THUMPED VIGOROUSLY UPON THE PAVEMENT WITH HIS STICK TWO OR THREE TIMES, HE WENT UP TO THE DOOR AND KNOCKED. IT WAS INSTANTLY OPENED BY A BRIGHT-LOOKING, CLEAN-SHAVEN YOUNG FELLOW, WHO ASKED HIM TO STEP IN.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THANK YOU,&#34; SAID HOLMES, &#34;I ONLY WISHED TO ASK YOU HOW YOU WOULD GO FROM HERE TO THE STRAND.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THIRD RIGHT, FOURTH LEFT,&#34; ANSWERED THE ASSISTANT PROMPTLY, CLOSING THE DOOR.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;SMART FELLOW, THAT,&#34; OBSERVED HOLMES AS WE WALKED AWAY. &#34;HE IS, IN MY JUDGMENT, THE FOURTH SMARTEST MAN IN LONDON, AND FOR DARING I AM NOT SURE THAT HE HAS NOT A CLAIM TO BE THIRD. I HAVE KNOWN SOMETHING OF HIM BEFORE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;EVIDENTLY,&#34; SAID I, &#34;MR. WILSON\\&#39;S ASSISTANT COUNTS FOR A GOOD DEAL IN THIS MYSTERY OF THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE. I AM SURE THAT YOU INQUIRED YOUR WAY MERELY IN ORDER THAT YOU MIGHT SEE HIM.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NOT HIM.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHAT THEN?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THE KNEES OF HIS TROUSERS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND WHAT DID YOU SEE?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHAT I EXPECTED TO SEE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHY DID YOU BEAT THE PAVEMENT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;MY DEAR DOCTOR, THIS IS A TIME FOR OBSERVATION, NOT FOR TALK. WE ARE SPIES IN AN ENEMY\\&#39;S COUNTRY. WE KNOW SOMETHING OF SAXE-COBURG SQUARE. LET US NOW EXPLORE THE PARTS WHICH LIE BEHIND IT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE ROAD IN WHICH WE FOUND OURSELVES AS WE TURNED ROUND THE CORNER FROM THE RETIRED SAXE-COBURG SQUARE PRESENTED AS GREAT A CONTRAST TO IT AS THE FRONT OF A PICTURE DOES TO THE BACK. IT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN ARTERIES WHICH CONVEYED THE TRAFFIC OF THE CITY TO THE NORTH AND WEST. THE ROADWAY WAS BLOCKED WITH THE IMMENSE STREAM OF COMMERCE FLOWING IN A DOUBLE TIDE INWARD AND OUTWARD, WHILE THE FOOTPATHS WERE BLACK WITH THE HURRYING SWARM OF PEDESTRIANS. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REALISE AS WE LOOKED AT THE LINE OF FINE SHOPS AND STATELY BUSINESS PREMISES THAT THEY REALLY ABUTTED ON THE OTHER SIDE UPON THE FADED AND STAGNANT SQUARE WHICH WE HAD JUST QUITTED.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;LET ME SEE,&#34; SAID HOLMES, STANDING AT THE CORNER AND GLANCING ALONG THE LINE, &#34;I SHOULD LIKE JUST TO REMEMBER THE ORDER OF THE HOUSES HERE. IT IS A HOBBY OF MINE TO HAVE AN EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF LONDON. THERE IS MORTIMER\\&#39;S, THE TOBACCONIST, THE LITTLE NEWSPAPER SHOP, THE COBURG BRANCH OF THE CITY AND SUBURBAN BANK, THE VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT, AND MCFARLANE\\&#39;S CARRIAGE-BUILDING DEPOT. THAT CARRIES US RIGHT ON TO THE OTHER BLOCK. AND NOW, DOCTOR, WE\\&#39;VE DONE OUR WORK, SO IT\\&#39;S TIME WE HAD SOME PLAY. A SANDWICH AND A CUP OF COFFEE, AND THEN OFF TO VIOLIN-LAND, WHERE ALL IS SWEETNESS AND DELICACY AND HARMONY, AND THERE ARE NO RED-HEADED CLIENTS TO VEX US WITH THEIR CONUNDRUMS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;MY FRIEND WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICIAN, BEING HIMSELF NOT ONLY A VERY CAPABLE PERFORMER BUT A COMPOSER OF NO ORDINARY MERIT. ALL THE AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE STALLS WRAPPED IN THE MOST PERFECT HAPPINESS, GENTLY WAVING HIS LONG, THIN FINGERS IN TIME TO THE MUSIC, WHILE HIS GENTLY SMILING FACE AND HIS LANGUID, DREAMY EYES WERE AS UNLIKE THOSE OF HOLMES THE SLEUTH-HOUND, HOLMES THE RELENTLESS, KEEN-WITTED, READY-HANDED CRIMINAL AGENT, AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE. IN HIS SINGULAR CHARACTER THE DUAL NATURE ALTERNATELY ASSERTED ITSELF, AND HIS EXTREME EXACTNESS AND ASTUTENESS REPRESENTED, AS I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT, THE REACTION AGAINST THE POETIC AND CONTEMPLATIVE MOOD WHICH OCCASIONALLY PREDOMINATED IN HIM. THE SWING OF HIS NATURE TOOK HIM FROM EXTREME LANGUOR TO DEVOURING ENERGY; AND, AS I KNEW WELL, HE WAS NEVER SO TRULY FORMIDABLE AS WHEN, FOR DAYS ON END, HE HAD BEEN LOUNGING IN HIS ARMCHAIR AMID HIS IMPROVISATIONS AND HIS BLACK-LETTER EDITIONS. THEN IT WAS THAT THE LUST OF THE CHASE WOULD SUDDENLY COME UPON HIM, AND THAT HIS BRILLIANT REASONING POWER WOULD RISE TO THE LEVEL OF INTUITION, UNTIL THOSE WHO WERE UNACQUAINTED WITH HIS METHODS WOULD LOOK ASKANCE AT HIM AS ON A MAN WHOSE KNOWLEDGE WAS NOT THAT OF OTHER MORTALS. WHEN I SAW HIM THAT AFTERNOON SO ENWRAPPED IN THE MUSIC AT ST. JAMES&#39;S HALL I FELT THAT AN EVIL TIME MIGHT BE COMING UPON THOSE WHOM HE HAD SET HIMSELF TO HUNT DOWN.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU WANT TO GO HOME, NO DOUBT, DOCTOR,&#34; HE REMARKED AS WE EMERGED.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YES, IT WOULD BE AS WELL.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND I HAVE SOME BUSINESS TO DO WHICH WILL TAKE SOME HOURS. THIS BUSINESS AT COBURG SQUARE IS SERIOUS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHY SERIOUS?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;A CONSIDERABLE CRIME IS IN CONTEMPLATION. I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WE SHALL BE IN TIME TO STOP IT. BUT TO-DAY BEING SATURDAY RATHER COMPLICATES MATTERS. I SHALL WANT YOUR HELP TO-NIGHT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AT WHAT TIME?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;TEN WILL BE EARLY ENOUGH.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I SHALL BE AT BAKER STREET AT TEN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;VERY WELL. AND, I SAY, DOCTOR, THERE MAY BE SOME LITTLE DANGER, SO KINDLY PUT YOUR ARMY REVOLVER IN YOUR POCKET.&#34; HE WAVED HIS HAND, TURNED ON HIS HEEL, AND DISAPPEARED IN AN INSTANT AMONG THE CROWD.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;I TRUST THAT I AM NOT MORE DENSE THAN MY NEIGHBOURS, BUT I WAS ALWAYS OPPRESSED WITH A SENSE OF MY OWN STUPIDITY IN MY DEALINGS WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES. HERE I HAD HEARD WHAT HE HAD HEARD, I HAD SEEN WHAT HE HAD SEEN, AND YET FROM HIS WORDS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE SAW CLEARLY NOT ONLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN, WHILE TO ME THE WHOLE BUSINESS WAS STILL CONFUSED AND GROTESQUE. AS I DROVE HOME TO MY HOUSE IN KENSINGTON I THOUGHT OVER IT ALL, FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF THE RED-HEADED COPIER OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA DOWN TO THE VISIT TO SAXE-COBURG SQUARE, AND THE OMINOUS WORDS WITH WHICH HE HAD PARTED FROM ME. WHAT WAS THIS NOCTURNAL EXPEDITION, AND WHY SHOULD I GO ARMED? WHERE WERE WE GOING, AND WHAT WERE WE TO DO? I HAD THE HINT FROM HOLMES THAT THIS SMOOTH-FACED PAWNBROKER&#39;S ASSISTANT WAS A FORMIDABLE MAN--A MAN WHO MIGHT PLAY A DEEP GAME. I TRIED TO PUZZLE IT OUT, BUT GAVE IT UP IN DESPAIR AND SET THE MATTER ASIDE UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD BRING AN EXPLANATION.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;IT WAS A QUARTER-PAST NINE WHEN I STARTED FROM HOME AND MADE MY WAY ACROSS THE PARK, AND SO THROUGH OXFORD STREET TO BAKER STREET. TWO HANSOMS WERE STANDING AT THE DOOR, AND AS I ENTERED THE PASSAGE I HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES FROM ABOVE. ON ENTERING HIS ROOM, I FOUND HOLMES IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION WITH TWO MEN, ONE OF WHOM I RECOGNISED AS PETER JONES, THE OFFICIAL POLICE AGENT, WHILE THE OTHER WAS A LONG, THIN, SAD-FACED MAN, WITH A VERY SHINY HAT AND OPPRESSIVELY RESPECTABLE FROCK-COAT.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;HA! OUR PARTY IS COMPLETE,&#34; SAID HOLMES, BUTTONING UP HIS PEA-JACKET AND TAKING HIS HEAVY HUNTING CROP FROM THE RACK. &#34;WATSON, I THINK YOU KNOW MR. JONES, OF SCOTLAND YARD? LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO MR. MERRYWEATHER, WHO IS TO BE OUR COMPANION IN TO-NIGHT\\&#39;S ADVENTURE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WE\\&#39;RE HUNTING IN COUPLES AGAIN, DOCTOR, YOU SEE,&#34; SAID JONES IN HIS CONSEQUENTIAL WAY. &#34;OUR FRIEND HERE IS A WONDERFUL MAN FOR STARTING A CHASE. ALL HE WANTS IS AN OLD DOG TO HELP HIM TO DO THE RUNNING DOWN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I HOPE A WILD GOOSE MAY NOT PROVE TO BE THE END OF OUR CHASE,&#34; OBSERVED MR. MERRYWEATHER GLOOMILY.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU MAY PLACE CONSIDERABLE CONFIDENCE IN MR. HOLMES, SIR,&#34; SAID THE POLICE AGENT LOFTILY. &#34;HE HAS HIS OWN LITTLE METHODS, WHICH ARE, IF HE WON\\&#39;T MIND MY SAYING SO, JUST A LITTLE TOO THEORETICAL AND FANTASTIC, BUT HE HAS THE MAKINGS OF A DETECTIVE IN HIM. IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT ONCE OR TWICE, AS IN THAT BUSINESS OF THE SHOLTO MURDER AND THE AGRA TREASURE, HE HAS BEEN MORE NEARLY CORRECT THAN THE OFFICIAL FORCE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;OH, IF YOU SAY SO, MR. JONES, IT IS ALL RIGHT,&#34; SAID THE STRANGER WITH DEFERENCE. &#34;STILL, I CONFESS THAT I MISS MY RUBBER. IT IS THE FIRST SATURDAY NIGHT FOR SEVEN-AND-TWENTY YEARS THAT I HAVE NOT HAD MY RUBBER.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I THINK YOU WILL FIND,&#34; SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES, &#34;THAT YOU WILL PLAY FOR A HIGHER STAKE TO-NIGHT THAN YOU HAVE EVER DONE YET, AND THAT THE PLAY WILL BE MORE EXCITING. FOR YOU, MR. MERRYWEATHER, THE STAKE WILL BE SOME $30,000; AND FOR YOU, JONES, IT WILL BE THE MAN UPON WHOM YOU WISH TO LAY YOUR HANDS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;JOHN CLAY, THE MURDERER, THIEF, SMASHER, AND FORGER. HE\\&#39;S A YOUNG MAN, MR. MERRYWEATHER, BUT HE IS AT THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION, AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE MY BRACELETS ON HIM THAN ON ANY CRIMINAL IN LONDON. HE\\&#39;S A REMARKABLE MAN, IS YOUNG JOHN CLAY. HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A ROYAL DUKE, AND HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN TO ETON AND OXFORD. HIS BRAIN IS AS CUNNING AS HIS FINGERS, AND THOUGH WE MEET SIGNS OF HIM AT EVERY TURN, WE NEVER KNOW WHERE TO FIND THE MAN HIMSELF. HE\\&#39;LL CRACK A CRIB IN SCOTLAND ONE WEEK, AND BE RAISING MONEY TO BUILD AN ORPHANAGE IN CORNWALL THE NEXT. I\\&#39;VE BEEN ON HIS TRACK FOR YEARS AND HAVE NEVER SET EYES ON HIM YET.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I HOPE THAT I MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING YOU TO-NIGHT. I\\&#39;VE HAD ONE OR TWO LITTLE TURNS ALSO WITH MR. JOHN CLAY, AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT HE IS AT THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION. IT IS PAST TEN, HOWEVER, AND QUITE TIME THAT WE STARTED. IF YOU TWO WILL TAKE THE FIRST HANSOM, WATSON AND I WILL FOLLOW IN THE SECOND.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS NOT VERY COMMUNICATIVE DURING THE LONG DRIVE AND LAY BACK IN THE CAB HUMMING THE TUNES WHICH HE HAD HEARD IN THE AFTERNOON. WE RATTLED THROUGH AN ENDLESS LABYRINTH OF GAS-LIT STREETS UNTIL WE EMERGED INTO FARRINGTON STREET.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WE ARE CLOSE THERE NOW,&#34; MY FRIEND REMARKED. &#34;THIS FELLOW MERRYWEATHER IS A BANK DIRECTOR, AND PERSONALLY INTERESTED IN THE MATTER. I THOUGHT IT AS WELL TO HAVE JONES WITH US ALSO. HE IS NOT A BAD FELLOW, THOUGH AN ABSOLUTE IMBECILE IN HIS PROFESSION. HE HAS ONE POSITIVE VIRTUE. HE IS AS BRAVE AS A BULLDOG AND AS TENACIOUS AS A LOBSTER IF HE GETS HIS CLAWS UPON ANYONE. HERE WE ARE, AND THEY ARE WAITING FOR US.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;WE HAD REACHED THE SAME CROWDED THOROUGHFARE IN WHICH WE HAD FOUND OURSELVES IN THE MORNING. OUR CABS WERE DISMISSED, AND, FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE OF MR. MERRYWEATHER, WE PASSED DOWN A NARROW PASSAGE AND THROUGH A SIDE DOOR, WHICH HE OPENED FOR US. WITHIN THERE WAS A SMALL CORRIDOR, WHICH ENDED IN A VERY MASSIVE IRON GATE. THIS ALSO WAS OPENED, AND LED DOWN A FLIGHT OF WINDING STONE STEPS, WHICH TERMINATED AT ANOTHER FORMIDABLE GATE. MR. MERRYWEATHER STOPPED TO LIGHT A LANTERN, AND THEN CONDUCTED US DOWN A DARK, EARTH-SMELLING PASSAGE, AND SO, AFTER OPENING A THIRD DOOR, INTO A HUGE VAULT OR CELLAR, WHICH WAS PILED ALL ROUND WITH CRATES AND MASSIVE BOXES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU ARE NOT VERY VULNERABLE FROM ABOVE,&#34; HOLMES REMARKED AS HE HELD UP THE LANTERN AND GAZED ABOUT HIM.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NOR FROM BELOW,&#34; SAID MR. MERRYWEATHER, STRIKING HIS STICK UPON THE FLAGS WHICH LINED THE FLOOR. &#34;WHY, DEAR ME, IT SOUNDS QUITE HOLLOW!&#34; HE REMARKED, LOOKING UP IN SURPRISE.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I MUST REALLY ASK YOU TO BE A LITTLE MORE QUIET!&#34; SAID HOLMES SEVERELY. &#34;YOU HAVE ALREADY IMPERILLED THE WHOLE SUCCESS OF OUR EXPEDITION. MIGHT I BEG THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SIT DOWN UPON ONE OF THOSE BOXES, AND NOT TO INTERFERE?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE SOLEMN MR. MERRYWEATHER PERCHED HIMSELF UPON A CRATE, WITH A VERY INJURED EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE, WHILE HOLMES FELL UPON HIS KNEES UPON THE FLOOR AND, WITH THE LANTERN AND A MAGNIFYING LENS, BEGAN TO EXAMINE MINUTELY THE CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES. A FEW SECONDS SUFFICED TO SATISFY HIM, FOR HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND PUT HIS GLASS IN HIS POCKET.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WE HAVE AT LEAST AN HOUR BEFORE US,&#34; HE REMARKED, &#34;FOR THEY CAN HARDLY TAKE ANY STEPS UNTIL THE GOOD PAWNBROKER IS SAFELY IN BED. THEN THEY WILL NOT LOSE A MINUTE, FOR THE SOONER THEY DO THEIR WORK THE LONGER TIME THEY WILL HAVE FOR THEIR ESCAPE. WE ARE AT PRESENT, DOCTOR--AS NO DOUBT YOU HAVE DIVINED--IN THE CELLAR OF THE CITY BRANCH OF ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL LONDON BANKS. MR. MERRYWEATHER IS THE CHAIRMAN OF DIRECTORS, AND HE WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT THERE ARE REASONS WHY THE MORE DARING CRIMINALS OF LONDON SHOULD TAKE A CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THIS CELLAR AT PRESENT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT IS OUR FRENCH GOLD,&#34; WHISPERED THE DIRECTOR. &#34;WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL WARNINGS THAT AN ATTEMPT MIGHT BE MADE UPON IT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOUR FRENCH GOLD?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YES. WE HAD OCCASION SOME MONTHS AGO TO STRENGTHEN OUR RESOURCES AND BORROWED FOR THAT PURPOSE 30,000 NAPOLEONS FROM THE BANK OF FRANCE. IT HAS BECOME KNOWN THAT WE HAVE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO UNPACK THE MONEY, AND THAT IT IS STILL LYING IN OUR CELLAR. THE CRATE UPON WHICH I SIT CONTAINS 2,000 NAPOLEONS PACKED BETWEEN LAYERS OF LEAD FOIL. OUR RESERVE OF BULLION IS MUCH LARGER AT PRESENT THAN IS USUALLY KEPT IN A SINGLE BRANCH OFFICE, AND THE DIRECTORS HAVE HAD MISGIVINGS UPON THE SUBJECT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHICH WERE VERY WELL JUSTIFIED,&#34; OBSERVED HOLMES. &#34;AND NOW IT IS TIME THAT WE ARRANGED OUR LITTLE PLANS. I EXPECT THAT WITHIN AN HOUR MATTERS WILL COME TO A HEAD. IN THE MEANTIME MR. MERRYWEATHER, WE MUST PUT THE SCREEN OVER THAT DARK LANTERN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND SIT IN THE DARK?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I AM AFRAID SO. I HAD BROUGHT A PACK OF CARDS IN MY POCKET, AND I THOUGHT THAT, AS WE WERE A PARTIE CARREE, YOU MIGHT HAVE YOUR RUBBER AFTER ALL. BUT I SEE THAT THE ENEMY\\&#39;S PREPARATIONS HAVE GONE SO FAR THAT WE CANNOT RISK THE PRESENCE OF A LIGHT. AND, FIRST OF ALL, WE MUST CHOOSE OUR POSITIONS. THESE ARE DARING MEN, AND THOUGH WE SHALL TAKE THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE, THEY MAY DO US SOME HARM UNLESS WE ARE CAREFUL. I SHALL STAND BEHIND THIS CRATE, AND DO YOU CONCEAL YOURSELVES BEHIND THOSE. THEN, WHEN I FLASH A LIGHT UPON THEM, CLOSE IN SWIFTLY. IF THEY FIRE, WATSON, HAVE NO COMPUNCTION ABOUT SHOOTING THEM DOWN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;I PLACED MY REVOLVER, COCKED, UPON THE TOP OF THE WOODEN CASE BEHIND WHICH I CROUCHED. HOLMES SHOT THE SLIDE ACROSS THE FRONT OF HIS LANTERN AND LEFT US IN PITCH DARKNESS--SUCH AN ABSOLUTE DARKNESS AS I HAVE NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED. THE SMELL OF HOT METAL REMAINED TO ASSURE US THAT THE LIGHT WAS STILL THERE, READY TO FLASH OUT AT A MOMENT&#39;S NOTICE. TO ME, WITH MY NERVES WORKED UP TO A PITCH OF EXPECTANCY, THERE WAS SOMETHING DEPRESSING AND SUBDUING IN THE SUDDEN GLOOM, AND IN THE COLD DANK AIR OF THE VAULT.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEY HAVE BUT ONE RETREAT,&#34; WHISPERED HOLMES. &#34;THAT IS BACK THROUGH THE HOUSE INTO SAXE-COBURG SQUARE. I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE DONE WHAT I ASKED YOU, JONES?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I HAVE AN INSPECTOR AND TWO OFFICERS WAITING AT THE FRONT DOOR.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN WE HAVE STOPPED ALL THE HOLES. AND NOW WE MUST BE SILENT AND WAIT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;WHAT A TIME IT SEEMED! FROM COMPARING NOTES AFTERWARDS IT WAS BUT AN HOUR AND A QUARTER, YET IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE NIGHT MUST HAVE ALMOST GONE, AND THE DAWN BE BREAKING ABOVE US. MY LIMBS WERE WEARY AND STIFF, FOR I FEARED TO CHANGE MY POSITION; YET MY NERVES WERE WORKED UP TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF TENSION, AND MY HEARING WAS SO ACUTE THAT I COULD NOT ONLY HEAR THE GENTLE BREATHING OF MY COMPANIONS, BUT I COULD DISTINGUISH THE DEEPER, HEAVIER IN-BREATH OF THE BULKY JONES FROM THE THIN, SIGHING NOTE OF THE BANK DIRECTOR. FROM MY POSITION I COULD LOOK OVER THE CASE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOOR. SUDDENLY MY EYES CAUGHT THE GLINT OF A LIGHT.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;AT FIRST IT WAS BUT A LURID SPARK UPON THE STONE PAVEMENT. THEN IT LENGTHENED OUT UNTIL IT BECAME A YELLOW LINE, AND THEN, WITHOUT ANY WARNING OR SOUND, A GASH SEEMED TO OPEN AND A HAND APPEARED, A WHITE, ALMOST WOMANLY HAND, WHICH FELT ABOUT IN THE CENTRE OF THE LITTLE AREA OF LIGHT. FOR A MINUTE OR MORE THE HAND, WITH ITS WRITHING FINGERS, PROTRUDED OUT OF THE FLOOR. THEN IT WAS WITHDRAWN AS SUDDENLY AS IT APPEARED, AND ALL WAS DARK AGAIN SAVE THE SINGLE LURID SPARK WHICH MARKED A CHINK BETWEEN THE STONES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;ITS DISAPPEARANCE, HOWEVER, WAS BUT MOMENTARY. WITH A RENDING, TEARING SOUND, ONE OF THE BROAD, WHITE STONES TURNED OVER UPON ITS SIDE AND LEFT A SQUARE, GAPING HOLE, THROUGH WHICH STREAMED THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN. OVER THE EDGE THERE PEEPED A CLEAN-CUT, BOYISH FACE, WHICH LOOKED KEENLY ABOUT IT, AND THEN, WITH A HAND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE APERTURE, DREW ITSELF SHOULDER-HIGH AND WAIST-HIGH, UNTIL ONE KNEE RESTED UPON THE EDGE. IN ANOTHER INSTANT HE STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE HOLE AND WAS HAULING AFTER HIM A COMPANION, LITHE AND SMALL LIKE HIMSELF, WITH A PALE FACE AND A SHOCK OF VERY RED HAIR.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT\\&#39;S ALL CLEAR,&#34; HE WHISPERED. &#34;HAVE YOU THE CHISEL AND THE BAGS? GREAT SCOTT! JUMP, ARCHIE, JUMP, AND I\\&#39;LL SWING FOR IT!&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD SPRUNG OUT AND SEIZED THE INTRUDER BY THE COLLAR. THE OTHER DIVED DOWN THE HOLE, AND I HEARD THE SOUND OF RENDING CLOTH AS JONES CLUTCHED AT HIS SKIRTS. THE LIGHT FLASHED UPON THE BARREL OF A REVOLVER, BUT HOLMES&#39; HUNTING CROP CAME DOWN ON THE MAN&#39;S WRIST, AND THE PISTOL CLINKED UPON THE STONE FLOOR.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT\\&#39;S NO USE, JOHN CLAY,&#34; SAID HOLMES BLANDLY. &#34;YOU HAVE NO CHANCE AT ALL.&#34;&#39;,\n ...]</div>","removedWidgets":[],"addedWidgets":{},"type":"html","arguments":{}}},"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/html":["<style scoped>\n  .ansiout {\n    display: block;\n    unicode-bidi: embed;\n    white-space: pre-wrap;\n    word-wrap: break-word;\n    word-break: break-all;\n    font-family: \"Source Code Pro\", \"Menlo\", monospace;;\n    font-size: 13px;\n    color: #555;\n    margin-left: 4px;\n    line-height: 19px;\n  }\n</style>\n<div class=\"ansiout\">Out[4]: [&#39;THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK OF THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES&#39;,\n &#39;BY SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE&#39;,\n &#39;(#15 IN OUR SERIES BY SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE)&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;COPYRIGHT LAWS ARE CHANGING ALL OVER THE WORLD.

A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;TO SHERLOCK HOLMES SHE IS ALWAYS THE WOMAN. I HAVE SELDOM HEARD HIM MENTION HER UNDER ANY OTHER NAME. IN HIS EYES SHE ECLIPSES AND PREDOMINATES THE WHOLE OF HER SEX. IT WAS NOT THAT HE FELT ANY EMOTION AKIN TO LOVE FOR IRENE ADLER. ALL EMOTIONS, AND THAT ONE PARTICULARLY, WERE ABHORRENT TO HIS COLD, PRECISE BUT ADMIRABLY BALANCED MIND. HE WAS, I TAKE IT, THE MOST PERFECT REASONING AND OBSERVING MACHINE THAT THE WORLD HAS SEEN, BUT AS A LOVER HE WOULD HAVE PLACED HIMSELF IN A FALSE POSITION. HE NEVER SPOKE OF THE SOFTER PASSIONS, SAVE WITH A GIBE AND A SNEER. THEY WERE ADMIRABLE THINGS FOR THE OBSERVER--EXCELLENT FOR DRAWING THE VEIL FROM MEN&#39;S MOTIVES AND ACTIONS. BUT FOR THE TRAINED REASONER TO ADMIT SUCH INTRUSIONS INTO HIS OWN DELICATE AND FINELY ADJUSTED TEMPERAMENT WAS TO INTRODUCE A DISTRACTING FACTOR WHICH MIGHT THROW A DOUBT UPON ALL HIS MENTAL RESULTS. GRIT IN A SENSITIVE INSTRUMENT, OR A CRACK IN ONE OF HIS OWN HIGH-POWER LENSES, WOULD NOT BE MORE DISTURBING THAN A STRONG EMOTION IN A NATURE SUCH AS HIS. AND YET THERE WAS BUT ONE WOMAN TO HIM, AND THAT WOMAN WAS THE LATE IRENE ADLER, OF DUBIOUS AND QUESTIONABLE MEMORY.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I HAD SEEN LITTLE OF HOLMES LATELY. MY MARRIAGE HAD DRIFTED US AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. MY OWN COMPLETE HAPPINESS, AND THE HOME-CENTRED INTERESTS WHICH RISE UP AROUND THE MAN WHO FIRST FINDS HIMSELF MASTER OF HIS OWN ESTABLISHMENT, WERE SUFFICIENT TO ABSORB ALL MY ATTENTION, WHILE HOLMES, WHO LOATHED EVERY FORM OF SOCIETY WITH HIS WHOLE BOHEMIAN SOUL, REMAINED IN OUR LODGINGS IN BAKER STREET, BURIED AMONG HIS OLD BOOKS, AND ALTERNATING FROM WEEK TO WEEK BETWEEN COCAINE AND AMBITION, THE DROWSINESS OF THE DRUG, AND THE FIERCE ENERGY OF HIS OWN KEEN NATURE. HE WAS STILL, AS EVER, DEEPLY ATTRACTED BY THE STUDY OF CRIME, AND OCCUPIED HIS IMMENSE FACULTIES AND EXTRAORDINARY POWERS OF OBSERVATION IN FOLLOWING OUT THOSE CLUES, AND CLEARING UP THOSE MYSTERIES WHICH HAD BEEN ABANDONED AS HOPELESS BY THE OFFICIAL POLICE. FROM TIME TO TIME I HEARD SOME VAGUE ACCOUNT OF HIS DOINGS: OF HIS SUMMONS TO ODESSA IN THE CASE OF THE TREPOFF MURDER, OF HIS CLEARING UP OF THE SINGULAR TRAGEDY OF THE ATKINSON BROTHERS AT TRINCOMALEE, AND FINALLY OF THE MISSION WHICH HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED SO DELICATELY AND SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE REIGNING FAMILY OF HOLLAND. BEYOND THESE SIGNS OF HIS ACTIVITY, HOWEVER, WHICH I MERELY SHARED WITH ALL THE READERS OF THE DAILY PRESS, I KNEW LITTLE OF MY FORMER FRIEND AND COMPANION.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;ONE NIGHT--IT WAS ON THE TWENTIETH OF MARCH, 1888--I WAS RETURNING FROM A JOURNEY TO A PATIENT (FOR I HAD NOW RETURNED TO CIVIL PRACTICE), WHEN MY WAY LED ME THROUGH BAKER STREET. AS I PASSED THE WELL-REMEMBERED DOOR, WHICH MUST ALWAYS BE ASSOCIATED IN MY MIND WITH MY WOOING, AND WITH THE DARK INCIDENTS OF THE STUDY IN SCARLET, I WAS SEIZED WITH A KEEN DESIRE TO SEE HOLMES AGAIN, AND TO KNOW HOW HE WAS EMPLOYING HIS EXTRAORDINARY POWERS. HIS ROOMS WERE BRILLIANTLY LIT, AND, EVEN AS I LOOKED UP, I SAW HIS TALL, SPARE FIGURE PASS TWICE IN A DARK SILHOUETTE AGAINST THE BLIND. HE WAS PACING THE ROOM SWIFTLY, EAGERLY, WITH HIS HEAD SUNK UPON HIS CHEST AND HIS HANDS CLASPED BEHIND HIM. TO ME, WHO KNEW HIS EVERY MOOD AND HABIT, HIS ATTITUDE AND MANNER TOLD THEIR OWN STORY. HE WAS AT WORK AGAIN. HE HAD RISEN OUT OF HIS DRUG-CREATED DREAMS AND WAS HOT UPON THE SCENT OF SOME NEW PROBLEM. I RANG THE BELL AND WAS SHOWN UP TO THE CHAMBER WHICH HAD FORMERLY BEEN IN PART MY OWN.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HIS MANNER WAS NOT EFFUSIVE. IT SELDOM WAS; BUT HE WAS GLAD, I THINK, TO SEE ME. WITH HARDLY A WORD SPOKEN, BUT WITH A KINDLY EYE, HE WAVED ME TO AN ARMCHAIR, THREW ACROSS HIS CASE OF CIGARS, AND INDICATED A SPIRIT CASE AND A GASOGENE IN THE CORNER. THEN HE STOOD BEFORE THE FIRE AND LOOKED ME OVER IN HIS SINGULAR INTROSPECTIVE FASHION.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WEDLOCK SUITS YOU,&#34; HE REMARKED. &#34;I THINK, WATSON, THAT YOU HAVE PUT ON SEVEN AND A HALF POUNDS SINCE I SAW YOU.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;SEVEN!&#34; I ANSWERED.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;INDEED, I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT A LITTLE MORE. JUST A TRIFLE MORE, I FANCY, WATSON. AND IN PRACTICE AGAIN, I OBSERVE. YOU DID NOT TELL ME THAT YOU INTENDED TO GO INTO HARNESS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN, HOW DO YOU KNOW?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I SEE IT, I DEDUCE IT. HOW DO I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE BEEN GETTING YOURSELF VERY WET LATELY, AND THAT YOU HAVE A MOST CLUMSY AND CARELESS SERVANT GIRL?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;MY DEAR HOLMES,&#34; SAID I, &#34;THIS IS TOO MUCH. YOU WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN BURNED, HAD YOU LIVED A FEW CENTURIES AGO. IT IS TRUE THAT I HAD A COUNTRY WALK ON THURSDAY AND CAME HOME IN A DREADFUL MESS, BUT AS I HAVE CHANGED MY CLOTHES I CAN\\&#39;T IMAGINE HOW YOU DEDUCE IT. AS TO MARY JANE, SHE IS INCORRIGIBLE, AND MY WIFE HAS GIVEN HER NOTICE, BUT THERE, AGAIN, I FAIL TO SEE HOW YOU WORK IT OUT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HE CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF AND RUBBED HIS LONG, NERVOUS HANDS TOGETHER.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT IS SIMPLICITY ITSELF,&#34; SAID HE; &#34;MY EYES TELL ME THAT ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR LEFT SHOE, JUST WHERE THE FIRELIGHT STRIKES IT, THE LEATHER IS SCORED BY SIX ALMOST PARALLEL CUTS. OBVIOUSLY THEY HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY SOMEONE WHO HAS VERY CARELESSLY SCRAPED ROUND THE EDGES OF THE SOLE IN ORDER TO REMOVE CRUSTED MUD FROM IT. HENCE, YOU SEE, MY DOUBLE DEDUCTION THAT YOU HAD BEEN OUT IN VILE WEATHER, AND THAT YOU HAD A PARTICULARLY MALIGNANT BOOT-SLITTING SPECIMEN OF THE LONDON SLAVEY. AS TO YOUR PRACTICE, IF A GENTLEMAN WALKS INTO MY ROOMS SMELLING OF IODOFORM, WITH A BLACK MARK OF NITRATE OF SILVER UPON HIS RIGHT FOREFINGER, AND A BULGE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF HIS TOP-HAT TO SHOW WHERE HE HAS SECRETED HIS STETHOSCOPE, I MUST BE DULL, INDEED, IF I DO NOT PRONOUNCE HIM TO BE AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THE EASE WITH WHICH HE EXPLAINED HIS PROCESS OF DEDUCTION. &#34;WHEN I HEAR YOU GIVE YOUR REASONS,&#34; I REMARKED, &#34;THE THING ALWAYS APPEARS TO ME TO BE SO RIDICULOUSLY SIMPLE THAT I COULD EASILY DO IT MYSELF, THOUGH AT EACH SUCCESSIVE INSTANCE OF YOUR REASONING I AM BAFFLED UNTIL YOU EXPLAIN YOUR PROCESS. AND YET I BELIEVE THAT MY EYES ARE AS GOOD AS YOURS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;QUITE SO,&#34; HE ANSWERED, LIGHTING A CIGARETTE, AND THROWING HIMSELF DOWN INTO AN ARMCHAIR. &#34;YOU SEE, BUT YOU DO NOT OBSERVE. THE DISTINCTION IS CLEAR. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU HAVE FREQUENTLY SEEN THE STEPS WHICH LEAD UP FROM THE HALL TO THIS ROOM.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;FREQUENTLY.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;HOW OFTEN?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WELL, SOME HUNDREDS OF TIMES.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN HOW MANY ARE THERE?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;HOW MANY? I DON\\&#39;T KNOW.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;QUITE SO! YOU HAVE NOT OBSERVED. AND YET YOU HAVE SEEN. THAT IS JUST MY POINT. NOW, I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVENTEEN STEPS, BECAUSE I HAVE BOTH SEEN AND OBSERVED. BY THE WAY, SINCE YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THESE LITTLE PROBLEMS, AND SINCE YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH TO CHRONICLE ONE OR TWO OF MY TRIFLING EXPERIENCES, YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN THIS.&#34; HE THREW OVER A SHEET OF THICK, PINK-TINTED NOTEPAPER WHICH HAD BEEN LYING OPEN UPON THE TABLE. &#34;IT CAME BY THE LAST POST,&#34; SAID HE. &#34;READ IT ALOUD.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE NOTE WAS UNDATED, AND WITHOUT EITHER SIGNATURE OR ADDRESS.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THERE WILL CALL UPON YOU TO-NIGHT, AT A QUARTER TO EIGHT O\\&#39;CLOCK,&#34; IT SAID, &#34;A GENTLEMAN WHO DESIRES TO CONSULT YOU UPON A MATTER OF THE VERY DEEPEST MOMENT. YOUR RECENT SERVICES TO ONE OF THE ROYAL HOUSES OF EUROPE HAVE SHOWN THAT YOU ARE ONE WHO MAY SAFELY BE TRUSTED WITH MATTERS WHICH ARE OF AN IMPORTANCE WHICH CAN HARDLY BE EXAGGERATED. THIS ACCOUNT OF YOU WE HAVE FROM ALL QUARTERS RECEIVED. BE IN YOUR CHAMBER THEN AT THAT HOUR, AND DO NOT TAKE IT AMISS IF YOUR VISITOR WEAR A MASK.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THIS IS INDEED A MYSTERY,&#34; I REMARKED. &#34;WHAT DO YOU IMAGINE THAT IT MEANS?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I HAVE NO DATA YET. IT IS A CAPITAL MISTAKE TO THEORISE BEFORE ONE HAS DATA. INSENSIBLY ONE BEGINS TO TWIST FACTS TO SUIT THEORIES, INSTEAD OF THEORIES TO SUIT FACTS. BUT THE NOTE ITSELF. WHAT DO YOU DEDUCE FROM IT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I CAREFULLY EXAMINED THE WRITING, AND THE PAPER UPON WHICH IT WAS WRITTEN.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THE MAN WHO WROTE IT WAS PRESUMABLY WELL TO DO,&#34; I REMARKED, ENDEAVOURING TO IMITATE MY COMPANION\\&#39;S PROCESSES. &#34;SUCH PAPER COULD NOT BE BOUGHT UNDER HALF A CROWN A PACKET. IT IS PECULIARLY STRONG AND STIFF.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;PECULIAR--THAT IS THE VERY WORD,&#34; SAID HOLMES. &#34;IT IS NOT AN ENGLISH PAPER AT ALL. HOLD IT UP TO THE LIGHT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I DID SO, AND SAW A LARGE &#34;E&#34; WITH A SMALL &#34;G,&#34; A &#34;P,&#34; AND A LARGE &#34;G&#34; WITH A SMALL &#34;T&#34; WOVEN INTO THE TEXTURE OF THE PAPER.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?&#34; ASKED HOLMES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THE NAME OF THE MAKER, NO DOUBT; OR HIS MONOGRAM, RATHER.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NOT AT ALL. THE \\&#39;G\\&#39; WITH THE SMALL \\&#39;T\\&#39; STANDS FOR \\&#39;GESELLSCHAFT,\\&#39; WHICH IS THE GERMAN FOR \\&#39;COMPANY.\\&#39; IT IS A CUSTOMARY CONTRACTION LIKE OUR \\&#39;CO.\\&#39; \\&#39;P,\\&#39; OF COURSE, STANDS FOR \\&#39;PAPIER.\\&#39; NOW FOR THE \\&#39;EG.\\&#39; LET US GLANCE AT OUR CONTINENTAL GAZETTEER.&#34; HE TOOK DOWN A HEAVY BROWN VOLUME FROM HIS SHELVES. &#34;EGLOW, EGLONITZ--HERE WE ARE, EGRIA. IT IS IN A GERMAN-SPEAKING COUNTRY--IN BOHEMIA, NOT FAR FROM CARLSBAD. \\&#39;REMARKABLE AS BEING THE SCENE OF THE DEATH OF WALLENSTEIN, AND FOR ITS NUMEROUS GLASS-FACTORIES AND PAPER-MILLS.\\&#39; HA, HA, MY BOY, WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?&#34; HIS EYES SPARKLED, AND HE SENT UP A GREAT BLUE TRIUMPHANT CLOUD FROM HIS CIGARETTE.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THE PAPER WAS MADE IN BOHEMIA,&#34; I SAID.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;PRECISELY. AND THE MAN WHO WROTE THE NOTE IS A GERMAN. DO YOU NOTE THE PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION OF THE SENTENCE--\\&#39;THIS ACCOUNT OF YOU WE HAVE FROM ALL QUARTERS RECEIVED.\\&#39; A FRENCHMAN OR RUSSIAN COULD NOT HAVE WRITTEN THAT. IT IS THE GERMAN WHO IS SO UNCOURTEOUS TO HIS VERBS. IT ONLY REMAINS, THEREFORE, TO DISCOVER WHAT IS WANTED BY THIS GERMAN WHO WRITES UPON BOHEMIAN PAPER AND PREFERS WEARING A MASK TO SHOWING HIS FACE. AND HERE HE COMES, IF I AM NOT MISTAKEN, TO RESOLVE ALL OUR DOUBTS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;AS HE SPOKE THERE WAS THE SHARP SOUND OF HORSES&#39; HOOFS AND GRATING WHEELS AGAINST THE CURB, FOLLOWED BY A SHARP PULL AT THE BELL. HOLMES WHISTLED.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;A PAIR, BY THE SOUND,&#34; SAID HE. &#34;YES,&#34; HE CONTINUED, GLANCING OUT OF THE WINDOW. &#34;A NICE LITTLE BROUGHAM AND A PAIR OF BEAUTIES. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY GUINEAS APIECE. THERE\\&#39;S MONEY IN THIS CASE, WATSON, IF THERE IS NOTHING ELSE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I THINK THAT I HAD BETTER GO, HOLMES.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NOT A BIT, DOCTOR. STAY WHERE YOU ARE. I AM LOST WITHOUT MY BOSWELL. AND THIS PROMISES TO BE INTERESTING. IT WOULD BE A PITY TO MISS IT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BUT YOUR CLIENT--&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NEVER MIND HIM. I MAY WANT YOUR HELP, AND SO MAY HE. HERE HE COMES. SIT DOWN IN THAT ARMCHAIR, DOCTOR, AND GIVE US YOUR BEST ATTENTION.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;A SLOW AND HEAVY STEP, WHICH HAD BEEN HEARD UPON THE STAIRS AND IN THE PASSAGE, PAUSED IMMEDIATELY OUTSIDE THE DOOR. THEN THERE WAS A LOUD AND AUTHORITATIVE TAP.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;COME IN!&#34; SAID HOLMES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;A MAN ENTERED WHO COULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN LESS THAN SIX FEET SIX INCHES IN HEIGHT, WITH THE CHEST AND LIMBS OF A HERCULES. HIS DRESS WAS RICH WITH A RICHNESS WHICH WOULD, IN ENGLAND, BE LOOKED UPON AS AKIN TO BAD TASTE. HEAVY BANDS OF ASTRAKHAN WERE SLASHED ACROSS THE SLEEVES AND FRONTS OF HIS DOUBLE-BREASTED COAT, WHILE THE DEEP BLUE CLOAK WHICH WAS THROWN OVER HIS SHOULDERS WAS LINED WITH FLAME-COLOURED SILK AND SECURED AT THE NECK WITH A BROOCH WHICH CONSISTED OF A SINGLE FLAMING BERYL. BOOTS WHICH EXTENDED HALFWAY UP HIS CALVES, AND WHICH WERE TRIMMED AT THE TOPS WITH RICH BROWN FUR, COMPLETED THE IMPRESSION OF BARBARIC OPULENCE WHICH WAS SUGGESTED BY HIS WHOLE APPEARANCE. HE CARRIED A BROAD-BRIMMED HAT IN HIS HAND, WHILE HE WORE ACROSS THE UPPER PART OF HIS FACE, EXTENDING DOWN PAST THE CHEEKBONES, A BLACK VIZARD MASK, WHICH HE HAD APPARENTLY ADJUSTED THAT VERY MOMENT, FOR HIS HAND WAS STILL RAISED TO IT AS HE ENTERED. FROM THE LOWER PART OF THE FACE HE APPEARED TO BE A MAN OF STRONG CHARACTER, WITH A THICK, HANGING LIP, AND A LONG, STRAIGHT CHIN SUGGESTIVE OF RESOLUTION PUSHED TO THE LENGTH OF OBSTINACY.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU HAD MY NOTE?&#34; HE ASKED WITH A DEEP HARSH VOICE AND A STRONGLY MARKED GERMAN ACCENT. &#34;I TOLD YOU THAT I WOULD CALL.&#34; HE LOOKED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER OF US, AS IF UNCERTAIN WHICH TO ADDRESS.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;PRAY TAKE A SEAT,&#34; SAID HOLMES. &#34;THIS IS MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE, DR. WATSON, WHO IS OCCASIONALLY GOOD ENOUGH TO HELP ME IN MY CASES. WHOM HAVE I THE HONOUR TO ADDRESS?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU MAY ADDRESS ME AS THE COUNT VON KRAMM, A BOHEMIAN NOBLEMAN. I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS GENTLEMAN, YOUR FRIEND, IS A MAN OF HONOUR AND DISCRETION, WHOM I MAY TRUST WITH A MATTER OF THE MOST EXTREME IMPORTANCE. IF NOT, I SHOULD MUCH PREFER TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU ALONE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;I ROSE TO GO, BUT HOLMES CAUGHT ME BY THE WRIST AND PUSHED ME BACK INTO MY CHAIR. &#34;IT IS BOTH, OR NONE,&#34; SAID HE. &#34;YOU MAY SAY BEFORE THIS GENTLEMAN ANYTHING WHICH YOU MAY SAY TO ME.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE COUNT SHRUGGED HIS BROAD SHOULDERS. &#34;THEN I MUST BEGIN,&#34; SAID HE, &#34;BY BINDING YOU BOTH TO ABSOLUTE SECRECY FOR TWO YEARS; AT THE END OF THAT TIME THE MATTER WILL BE OF NO IMPORTANCE. AT PRESENT IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT IT IS OF SUCH WEIGHT IT MAY HAVE AN INFLUENCE UPON EUROPEAN HISTORY.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I PROMISE,&#34; SAID HOLMES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND I.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU WILL EXCUSE THIS MASK,&#34; CONTINUED OUR STRANGE VISITOR. &#34;THE AUGUST PERSON WHO EMPLOYS ME WISHES HIS AGENT TO BE UNKNOWN TO YOU, AND I MAY CONFESS AT ONCE THAT THE TITLE BY WHICH I HAVE JUST CALLED MYSELF IS NOT EXACTLY MY OWN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I WAS AWARE OF IT,&#34; SAID HOLMES DRYLY.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE OF GREAT DELICACY, AND EVERY PRECAUTION HAS TO BE TAKEN TO QUENCH WHAT MIGHT GROW TO BE AN IMMENSE SCANDAL AND SERIOUSLY COMPROMISE ONE OF THE REIGNING FAMILIES OF EUROPE. TO SPEAK PLAINLY, THE MATTER IMPLICATES THE GREAT HOUSE OF ORMSTEIN, HEREDITARY KINGS OF BOHEMIA.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I WAS ALSO AWARE OF THAT,&#34; MURMURED HOLMES, SETTLING HIMSELF DOWN IN HIS ARMCHAIR AND CLOSING HIS EYES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;OUR VISITOR GLANCED WITH SOME APPARENT SURPRISE AT THE LANGUID, LOUNGING FIGURE OF THE MAN WHO HAD BEEN NO DOUBT DEPICTED TO HIM AS THE MOST INCISIVE REASONER AND MOST ENERGETIC AGENT IN EUROPE. HOLMES SLOWLY REOPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED IMPATIENTLY AT HIS GIGANTIC CLIENT.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IF YOUR MAJESTY WOULD CONDESCEND TO STATE YOUR CASE,&#34; HE REMARKED, &#34;I SHOULD BE BETTER ABLE TO ADVISE YOU.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE MAN SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND PACED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM IN UNCONTROLLABLE AGITATION. THEN, WITH A GESTURE OF DESPERATION, HE TORE THE MASK FROM HIS FACE AND HURLED IT UPON THE GROUND. &#34;YOU ARE RIGHT,&#34; HE CRIED; &#34;I AM THE KING. WHY SHOULD I ATTEMPT TO CONCEAL IT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHY, INDEED?&#34; MURMURED HOLMES. &#34;YOUR MAJESTY HAD NOT SPOKEN BEFORE I WAS AWARE THAT I WAS ADDRESSING WILHELM GOTTSREICH SIGISMOND VON ORMSTEIN, GRAND DUKE OF CASSEL-FELSTEIN, AND HEREDITARY KING OF BOHEMIA.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND,&#34; SAID OUR STRANGE VISITOR, SITTING DOWN ONCE MORE AND PASSING HIS HAND OVER HIS HIGH WHITE FOREHEAD, &#34;YOU CAN UNDERSTAND THAT I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED TO DOING SUCH BUSINESS IN MY OWN PERSON. YET THE MATTER WAS SO DELICATE THAT I COULD NOT CONFIDE IT TO AN AGENT WITHOUT PUTTING MYSELF IN HIS POWER. I HAVE COME INCOGNITO FROM PRAGUE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSULTING YOU.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN, PRAY CONSULT,&#34; SAID HOLMES, SHUTTING HIS EYES ONCE MORE.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THE FACTS ARE BRIEFLY THESE: SOME FIVE YEARS AGO, DURING A LENGTHY VISIT TO WARSAW, I MADE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF THE WELL-KNOWN ADVENTURESS, IRENE ADLER. THE NAME IS NO DOUBT FAMILIAR TO YOU.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;KINDLY LOOK HER UP IN MY INDEX, DOCTOR,&#34; MURMURED HOLMES WITHOUT OPENING HIS EYES. FOR MANY YEARS HE HAD ADOPTED A SYSTEM OF DOCKETING ALL PARAGRAPHS CONCERNING MEN AND THINGS, SO THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT TO NAME A SUBJECT OR A PERSON ON WHICH HE COULD NOT AT ONCE FURNISH INFORMATION. IN THIS CASE I FOUND HER BIOGRAPHY SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN THAT OF A HEBREW RABBI AND THAT OF A STAFF-COMMANDER WHO HAD WRITTEN A MONOGRAPH UPON THE DEEP-SEA FISHES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;LET ME SEE!&#34; SAID HOLMES. &#34;HUM! BORN IN NEW JERSEY IN THE YEAR 1858. CONTRALTO--HUM! LA SCALA, HUM! PRIMA DONNA IMPERIAL OPERA OF WARSAW--YES! RETIRED FROM OPERATIC STAGE--HA! LIVING IN LONDON--QUITE SO! YOUR MAJESTY, AS I UNDERSTAND, BECAME ENTANGLED WITH THIS YOUNG PERSON, WROTE HER SOME COMPROMISING LETTERS, AND IS NOW DESIROUS OF GETTING THOSE LETTERS BACK.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;PRECISELY SO. BUT HOW--&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WAS THERE A SECRET MARRIAGE?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NONE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NO LEGAL PAPERS OR CERTIFICATES?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NONE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN I FAIL TO FOLLOW YOUR MAJESTY. IF THIS YOUNG PERSON SHOULD PRODUCE HER LETTERS FOR BLACKMAILING OR OTHER PURPOSES, HOW IS SHE TO PROVE THEIR AUTHENTICITY?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THERE IS THE WRITING.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;POOH, POOH! FORGERY.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;MY PRIVATE NOTE-PAPER.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;STOLEN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;MY OWN SEAL.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IMITATED.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;MY PHOTOGRAPH.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BOUGHT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WE WERE BOTH IN THE PHOTOGRAPH.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;OH, DEAR! THAT IS VERY BAD! YOUR MAJESTY HAS INDEED COMMITTED AN INDISCRETION.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I WAS MAD--INSANE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU HAVE COMPROMISED YOURSELF SERIOUSLY.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I WAS ONLY CROWN PRINCE THEN. I WAS YOUNG. I AM BUT THIRTY NOW.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT MUST BE RECOVERED.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WE HAVE TRIED AND FAILED.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOUR MAJESTY MUST PAY. IT MUST BE BOUGHT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;SHE WILL NOT SELL.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;STOLEN, THEN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;FIVE ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE. TWICE BURGLARS IN MY PAY RANSACKED HER HOUSE. ONCE WE DIVERTED HER LUGGAGE WHEN SHE TRAVELLED. TWICE SHE HAS BEEN WAYLAID. THERE HAS BEEN NO RESULT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NO SIGN OF IT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;ABSOLUTELY NONE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HOLMES LAUGHED. &#34;IT IS QUITE A PRETTY LITTLE PROBLEM,&#34; SAID HE.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BUT A VERY SERIOUS ONE TO ME,&#34; RETURNED THE KING REPROACHFULLY.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;VERY, INDEED. AND WHAT DOES SHE PROPOSE TO DO WITH THE PHOTOGRAPH?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;TO RUIN ME.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BUT HOW?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I AM ABOUT TO BE MARRIED.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;SO I HAVE HEARD.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;TO CLOTILDE LOTHMAN VON SAXE-MENINGEN, SECOND DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF SCANDINAVIA. YOU MAY KNOW THE STRICT PRINCIPLES OF HER FAMILY. SHE IS HERSELF THE VERY SOUL OF DELICACY. A SHADOW OF A DOUBT AS TO MY CONDUCT WOULD BRING THE MATTER TO AN END.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND IRENE ADLER?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THREATENS TO SEND THEM THE PHOTOGRAPH. AND SHE WILL DO IT. I KNOW THAT SHE WILL DO IT. YOU DO NOT KNOW HER, BUT SHE HAS A SOUL OF STEEL. SHE HAS THE FACE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL OF WOMEN, AND THE MIND OF THE MOST RESOLUTE OF MEN. RATHER THAN I SHOULD MARRY ANOTHER WOMAN, THERE ARE NO LENGTHS TO WHICH SHE WOULD NOT GO--NONE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU ARE SURE THAT SHE HAS NOT SENT IT YET?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I AM SURE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND WHY?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BECAUSE SHE HAS SAID THAT SHE WOULD SEND IT ON THE DAY WHEN THE BETROTHAL WAS PUBLICLY PROCLAIMED. THAT WILL BE NEXT MONDAY.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;OH, THEN WE HAVE THREE DAYS YET,&#34; SAID HOLMES WITH A YAWN. &#34;THAT IS VERY FORTUNATE, AS I HAVE ONE OR TWO MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE TO LOOK INTO JUST AT PRESENT. YOUR MAJESTY WILL, OF COURSE, STAY IN LONDON FOR THE PRESENT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;CERTAINLY. YOU WILL FIND ME AT THE LANGHAM UNDER THE NAME OF THE COUNT VON KRAMM.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN I SHALL DROP YOU A LINE TO LET YOU KNOW HOW WE PROGRESS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;PRAY DO SO. I SHALL BE ALL ANXIETY.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN, AS TO MONEY?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU HAVE CARTE BLANCHE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;ABSOLUTELY?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I TELL YOU THAT I WOULD GIVE ONE OF THE PROVINCES OF MY KINGDOM TO HAVE THAT PHOTOGRAPH.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND FOR PRESENT EXPENSES?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE KING TOOK A HEAVY CHAMOIS LEATHER BAG FROM UNDER HIS CLOAK AND LAID IT ON THE TABLE.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THERE ARE THREE HUNDRED POUNDS IN GOLD AND SEVEN HUNDRED IN NOTES,&#34; HE SAID.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HOLMES SCRIBBLED A RECEIPT UPON A SHEET OF HIS NOTE-BOOK AND HANDED IT TO HIM.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND MADEMOISELLE\\&#39;S ADDRESS?&#34; HE ASKED.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IS BRIONY LODGE, SERPENTINE AVENUE, ST. JOHN\\&#39;S WOOD.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HOLMES TOOK A NOTE OF IT. &#34;ONE OTHER QUESTION,&#34; SAID HE. &#34;WAS THE PHOTOGRAPH A CABINET?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT WAS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN, GOOD-NIGHT, YOUR MAJESTY, AND I TRUST THAT WE SHALL SOON HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. AND GOOD-NIGHT, WATSON,&#34; HE ADDED, AS THE WHEELS OF THE ROYAL BROUGHAM ROLLED DOWN THE STREET. &#34;IF YOU WILL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO CALL TO-MORROW AFTERNOON AT THREE O\\&#39;CLOCK I SHOULD LIKE TO CHAT THIS LITTLE MATTER OVER WITH YOU.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;II.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;AT THREE O&#39;CLOCK PRECISELY I WAS AT BAKER STREET, BUT HOLMES HAD NOT YET RETURNED. THE LANDLADY INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD LEFT THE HOUSE SHORTLY AFTER EIGHT O&#39;CLOCK IN THE MORNING. I SAT DOWN BESIDE THE FIRE, HOWEVER, WITH THE INTENTION OF AWAITING HIM, HOWEVER LONG HE MIGHT BE. I WAS ALREADY DEEPLY INTERESTED IN HIS INQUIRY, FOR, THOUGH IT WAS SURROUNDED BY NONE OF THE GRIM AND STRANGE FEATURES WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TWO CRIMES WHICH I HAVE ALREADY RECORDED, STILL, THE NATURE OF THE CASE AND THE EXALTED STATION OF HIS CLIENT GAVE IT A CHARACTER OF ITS OWN. INDEED, APART FROM THE NATURE OF THE INVESTIGATION WHICH MY FRIEND HAD ON HAND, THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS MASTERLY GRASP OF A SITUATION, AND HIS KEEN, INCISIVE REASONING, WHICH MADE IT A PLEASURE TO ME TO STUDY HIS SYSTEM OF WORK, AND TO FOLLOW THE QUICK, SUBTLE METHODS BY WHICH HE DISENTANGLED THE MOST INEXTRICABLE MYSTERIES. SO ACCUSTOMED WAS I TO HIS INVARIABLE SUCCESS THAT THE VERY POSSIBILITY OF HIS FAILING HAD CEASED TO ENTER INTO MY HEAD.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;IT WAS CLOSE UPON FOUR BEFORE THE DOOR OPENED, AND A DRUNKEN-LOOKING GROOM, ILL-KEMPT AND SIDE-WHISKERED, WITH AN INFLAMED FACE AND DISREPUTABLE CLOTHES, WALKED INTO THE ROOM. ACCUSTOMED AS I WAS TO MY FRIEND&#39;S AMAZING POWERS IN THE USE OF DISGUISES, I HAD TO LOOK THREE TIMES BEFORE I WAS CERTAIN THAT IT WAS INDEED HE. WITH A NOD HE VANISHED INTO THE BEDROOM, WHENCE HE EMERGED IN FIVE MINUTES TWEED-SUITED AND RESPECTABLE, AS OF OLD. PUTTING HIS HANDS INTO HIS POCKETS, HE STRETCHED OUT HIS LEGS IN FRONT OF THE FIRE AND LAUGHED HEARTILY FOR SOME MINUTES.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WELL, REALLY!&#34; HE CRIED, AND THEN HE CHOKED AND LAUGHED AGAIN UNTIL HE WAS OBLIGED TO LIE BACK, LIMP AND HELPLESS, IN THE CHAIR.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHAT IS IT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT\\&#39;S QUITE TOO FUNNY. I AM SURE YOU COULD NEVER GUESS HOW I EMPLOYED MY MORNING, OR WHAT I ENDED BY DOING.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I CAN\\&#39;T IMAGINE. I SUPPOSE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN WATCHING THE HABITS, AND PERHAPS THE HOUSE, OF MISS IRENE ADLER.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;QUITE SO; BUT THE SEQUEL WAS RATHER UNUSUAL. I WILL TELL YOU, HOWEVER. I LEFT THE HOUSE A LITTLE AFTER EIGHT O\\&#39;CLOCK THIS MORNING IN THE CHARACTER OF A GROOM OUT OF WORK. THERE IS A WONDERFUL SYMPATHY AND FREEMASONRY AMONG HORSEY MEN. BE ONE OF THEM, AND YOU WILL KNOW ALL THAT THERE IS TO KNOW. I SOON FOUND BRIONY LODGE. IT IS A BIJOU VILLA, WITH A GARDEN AT THE BACK, BUT BUILT OUT IN FRONT RIGHT UP TO THE ROAD, TWO STORIES. CHUBB LOCK TO THE DOOR. LARGE SITTING-ROOM ON THE RIGHT SIDE, WELL FURNISHED, WITH LONG WINDOWS ALMOST TO THE FLOOR, AND THOSE PREPOSTEROUS ENGLISH WINDOW FASTENERS WHICH A CHILD COULD OPEN. BEHIND THERE WAS NOTHING REMARKABLE, SAVE THAT THE PASSAGE WINDOW COULD BE REACHED FROM THE TOP OF THE COACH-HOUSE. I WALKED ROUND IT AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW, BUT WITHOUT NOTING ANYTHING ELSE OF INTEREST.&#39;,\n\n*** WARNING: skipped 46492 bytes of output ***\n\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;EIGHT WEEKS PASSED AWAY LIKE THIS, AND I HAD WRITTEN ABOUT ABBOTS AND ARCHERY AND ARMOUR AND ARCHITECTURE AND ATTICA, AND HOPED WITH DILIGENCE THAT I MIGHT GET ON TO THE B\\&#39;S BEFORE VERY LONG. IT COST ME SOMETHING IN FOOLSCAP, AND I HAD PRETTY NEARLY FILLED A SHELF WITH MY WRITINGS. AND THEN SUDDENLY THE WHOLE BUSINESS CAME TO AN END.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;TO AN END?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YES, SIR. AND NO LATER THAN THIS MORNING. I WENT TO MY WORK AS USUAL AT TEN O\\&#39;CLOCK, BUT THE DOOR WAS SHUT AND LOCKED, WITH A LITTLE SQUARE OF CARDBOARD HAMMERED ON TO THE MIDDLE OF THE PANEL WITH A TACK. HERE IT IS, AND YOU CAN READ FOR YOURSELF.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HE HELD UP A PIECE OF WHITE CARDBOARD ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SHEET OF NOTE-PAPER. IT READ IN THIS FASHION:&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;IS&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;DISSOLVED.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;OCTOBER 9, 1890.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;SHERLOCK HOLMES AND I SURVEYED THIS CURT ANNOUNCEMENT AND THE RUEFUL FACE BEHIND IT, UNTIL THE COMICAL SIDE OF THE AFFAIR SO COMPLETELY OVERTOPPED EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION THAT WE BOTH BURST OUT INTO A ROAR OF LAUGHTER.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I CANNOT SEE THAT THERE IS ANYTHING VERY FUNNY,&#34; CRIED OUR CLIENT, FLUSHING UP TO THE ROOTS OF HIS FLAMING HEAD. &#34;IF YOU CAN DO NOTHING BETTER THAN LAUGH AT ME, I CAN GO ELSEWHERE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NO, NO,&#34; CRIED HOLMES, SHOVING HIM BACK INTO THE CHAIR FROM WHICH HE HAD HALF RISEN. &#34;I REALLY WOULDN\\&#39;T MISS YOUR CASE FOR THE WORLD. IT IS MOST REFRESHINGLY UNUSUAL. BUT THERE IS, IF YOU WILL EXCUSE MY SAYING SO, SOMETHING JUST A LITTLE FUNNY ABOUT IT. PRAY WHAT STEPS DID YOU TAKE WHEN YOU FOUND THE CARD UPON THE DOOR?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I WAS STAGGERED, SIR. I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO. THEN I CALLED AT THE OFFICES ROUND, BUT NONE OF THEM SEEMED TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT. FINALLY, I WENT TO THE LANDLORD, WHO IS AN ACCOUNTANT LIVING ON THE GROUND FLOOR, AND I ASKED HIM IF HE COULD TELL ME WHAT HAD BECOME OF THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE. HE SAID THAT HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF ANY SUCH BODY. THEN I ASKED HIM WHO MR. DUNCAN ROSS WAS. HE ANSWERED THAT THE NAME WAS NEW TO HIM.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34; \\&#39;WELL,\\&#39; SAID I, \\&#39;THE GENTLEMAN AT NO. 4.\\&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34; \\&#39;WHAT, THE RED-HEADED MAN?\\&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34; \\&#39;YES.\\&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34; \\&#39;OH,\\&#39; SAID HE, \\&#39;HIS NAME WAS WILLIAM MORRIS. HE WAS A SOLICITOR AND WAS USING MY ROOM AS A TEMPORARY CONVENIENCE UNTIL HIS NEW PREMISES WERE READY. HE MOVED OUT YESTERDAY.\\&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34; \\&#39;WHERE COULD I FIND HIM?\\&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34; \\&#39;OH, AT HIS NEW OFFICES. HE DID TELL ME THE ADDRESS. YES, 17 KING EDWARD STREET, NEAR ST. PAUL\\&#39;S.\\&#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I STARTED OFF, MR. HOLMES, BUT WHEN I GOT TO THAT ADDRESS IT WAS A MANUFACTORY OF ARTIFICIAL KNEE-CAPS, AND NO ONE IN IT HAD EVER HEARD OF EITHER MR. WILLIAM MORRIS OR MR. DUNCAN ROSS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND WHAT DID YOU DO THEN?&#34; ASKED HOLMES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I WENT HOME TO SAXE-COBURG SQUARE, AND I TOOK THE ADVICE OF MY ASSISTANT. BUT HE COULD NOT HELP ME IN ANY WAY. HE COULD ONLY SAY THAT IF I WAITED I SHOULD HEAR BY POST. BUT THAT WAS NOT QUITE GOOD ENOUGH, MR. HOLMES. I DID NOT WISH TO LOSE SUCH A PLACE WITHOUT A STRUGGLE, SO, AS I HAD HEARD THAT YOU WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO GIVE ADVICE TO POOR FOLK WHO WERE IN NEED OF IT, I CAME RIGHT AWAY TO YOU.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND YOU DID VERY WISELY,&#34; SAID HOLMES. &#34;YOUR CASE IS AN EXCEEDINGLY REMARKABLE ONE, AND I SHALL BE HAPPY TO LOOK INTO IT. FROM WHAT YOU HAVE TOLD ME I THINK THAT IT IS POSSIBLE THAT GRAVER ISSUES HANG FROM IT THAN MIGHT AT FIRST SIGHT APPEAR.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;GRAVE ENOUGH!&#34; SAID MR. JABEZ WILSON. &#34;WHY, I HAVE LOST FOUR POUND A WEEK.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AS FAR AS YOU ARE PERSONALLY CONCERNED,&#34; REMARKED HOLMES, &#34;I DO NOT SEE THAT YOU HAVE ANY GRIEVANCE AGAINST THIS EXTRAORDINARY LEAGUE. ON THE CONTRARY, YOU ARE, AS I UNDERSTAND, RICHER BY SOME $30, TO SAY NOTHING OF THE MINUTE KNOWLEDGE WHICH YOU HAVE GAINED ON EVERY SUBJECT WHICH COMES UNDER THE LETTER A. YOU HAVE LOST NOTHING BY THEM.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NO, SIR. BUT I WANT TO FIND OUT ABOUT THEM, AND WHO THEY ARE, AND WHAT THEIR OBJECT WAS IN PLAYING THIS PRANK--IF IT WAS A PRANK--UPON ME. IT WAS A PRETTY EXPENSIVE JOKE FOR THEM, FOR IT COST THEM TWO AND THIRTY POUNDS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WE SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO CLEAR UP THESE POINTS FOR YOU. AND, FIRST, ONE OR TWO QUESTIONS, MR. WILSON. THIS ASSISTANT OF YOURS WHO FIRST CALLED YOUR ATTENTION TO THE ADVERTISEMENT--HOW LONG HAD HE BEEN WITH YOU?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;ABOUT A MONTH THEN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;HOW DID HE COME?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IN ANSWER TO AN ADVERTISEMENT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WAS HE THE ONLY APPLICANT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NO, I HAD A DOZEN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHY DID YOU PICK HIM?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;BECAUSE HE WAS HANDY AND WOULD COME CHEAP.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AT HALF WAGES, IN FACT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YES.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHAT IS HE LIKE, THIS VINCENT SPAULDING?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;SMALL, STOUT-BUILT, VERY QUICK IN HIS WAYS, NO HAIR ON HIS FACE, THOUGH HE\\&#39;S NOT SHORT OF THIRTY. HAS A WHITE SPLASH OF ACID UPON HIS FOREHEAD.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;HOLMES SAT UP IN HIS CHAIR IN CONSIDERABLE EXCITEMENT. &#34;I THOUGHT AS MUCH,&#34; SAID HE. &#34;HAVE YOU EVER OBSERVED THAT HIS EARS ARE PIERCED FOR EARRINGS?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YES, SIR. HE TOLD ME THAT A GIPSY HAD DONE IT FOR HIM WHEN HE WAS A LAD.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;HUM!&#34; SAID HOLMES, SINKING BACK IN DEEP THOUGHT. &#34;HE IS STILL WITH YOU?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;OH, YES, SIR; I HAVE ONLY JUST LEFT HIM.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND HAS YOUR BUSINESS BEEN ATTENDED TO IN YOUR ABSENCE?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF, SIR. THERE\\&#39;S NEVER VERY MUCH TO DO OF A MORNING.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THAT WILL DO, MR. WILSON. I SHALL BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU AN OPINION UPON THE SUBJECT IN THE COURSE OF A DAY OR TWO. TO-DAY IS SATURDAY, AND I HOPE THAT BY MONDAY WE MAY COME TO A CONCLUSION.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WELL, WATSON,&#34; SAID HOLMES WHEN OUR VISITOR HAD LEFT US, &#34;WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT ALL?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I MAKE NOTHING OF IT,&#34; I ANSWERED FRANKLY. &#34;IT IS A MOST MYSTERIOUS BUSINESS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AS A RULE,&#34; SAID HOLMES, &#34;THE MORE BIZARRE A THING IS THE LESS MYSTERIOUS IT PROVES TO BE. IT IS YOUR COMMONPLACE, FEATURELESS CRIMES WHICH ARE REALLY PUZZLING, JUST AS A COMMONPLACE FACE IS THE MOST DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY. BUT I MUST BE PROMPT OVER THIS MATTER.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO, THEN?&#34; I ASKED.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;TO SMOKE,&#34; HE ANSWERED. &#34;IT IS QUITE A THREE PIPE PROBLEM, AND I BEG THAT YOU WON\\&#39;T SPEAK TO ME FOR FIFTY MINUTES.&#34; HE CURLED HIMSELF UP IN HIS CHAIR, WITH HIS THIN KNEES DRAWN UP TO HIS HAWK-LIKE NOSE, AND THERE HE SAT WITH HIS EYES CLOSED AND HIS BLACK CLAY PIPE THRUSTING OUT LIKE THE BILL OF SOME STRANGE BIRD. I HAD COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HE HAD DROPPED ASLEEP, AND INDEED WAS NODDING MYSELF, WHEN HE SUDDENLY SPRANG OUT OF HIS CHAIR WITH THE GESTURE OF A MAN WHO HAS MADE UP HIS MIND AND PUT HIS PIPE DOWN UPON THE MANTELPIECE.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;SARASATE PLAYS AT THE ST. JAMES\\&#39;S HALL THIS AFTERNOON,&#34; HE REMARKED. &#34;WHAT DO YOU THINK, WATSON? COULD YOUR PATIENTS SPARE YOU FOR A FEW HOURS?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I HAVE NOTHING TO DO TO-DAY. MY PRACTICE IS NEVER VERY ABSORBING.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN PUT ON YOUR HAT AND COME. I AM GOING THROUGH THE CITY FIRST, AND WE CAN HAVE SOME LUNCH ON THE WAY. I OBSERVE THAT THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF GERMAN MUSIC ON THE PROGRAMME, WHICH IS RATHER MORE TO MY TASTE THAN ITALIAN OR FRENCH. IT IS INTROSPECTIVE, AND I WANT TO INTROSPECT. COME ALONG!&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;WE TRAVELLED BY THE UNDERGROUND AS FAR AS ALDERSGATE; AND A SHORT WALK TOOK US TO SAXE-COBURG SQUARE, THE SCENE OF THE SINGULAR STORY WHICH WE HAD LISTENED TO IN THE MORNING. IT WAS A POKY, LITTLE, SHABBY-GENTEEL PLACE, WHERE FOUR LINES OF DINGY TWO-STORIED BRICK HOUSES LOOKED OUT INTO A SMALL RAILED-IN ENCLOSURE, WHERE A LAWN OF WEEDY GRASS AND A FEW CLUMPS OF FADED LAUREL BUSHES MADE A HARD FIGHT AGAINST A SMOKE-LADEN AND UNCONGENIAL ATMOSPHERE. THREE GILT BALLS AND A BROWN BOARD WITH &#34;JABEZ WILSON&#34; IN WHITE LETTERS, UPON A CORNER HOUSE, ANNOUNCED THE PLACE WHERE OUR RED-HEADED CLIENT CARRIED ON HIS BUSINESS. SHERLOCK HOLMES STOPPED IN FRONT OF IT WITH HIS HEAD ON ONE SIDE AND LOOKED IT ALL OVER, WITH HIS EYES SHINING BRIGHTLY BETWEEN PUCKERED LIDS. THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY UP THE STREET, AND THEN DOWN AGAIN TO THE CORNER, STILL LOOKING KEENLY AT THE HOUSES. FINALLY HE RETURNED TO THE PAWNBROKER\\&#39;S, AND, HAVING THUMPED VIGOROUSLY UPON THE PAVEMENT WITH HIS STICK TWO OR THREE TIMES, HE WENT UP TO THE DOOR AND KNOCKED. IT WAS INSTANTLY OPENED BY A BRIGHT-LOOKING, CLEAN-SHAVEN YOUNG FELLOW, WHO ASKED HIM TO STEP IN.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THANK YOU,&#34; SAID HOLMES, &#34;I ONLY WISHED TO ASK YOU HOW YOU WOULD GO FROM HERE TO THE STRAND.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THIRD RIGHT, FOURTH LEFT,&#34; ANSWERED THE ASSISTANT PROMPTLY, CLOSING THE DOOR.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;SMART FELLOW, THAT,&#34; OBSERVED HOLMES AS WE WALKED AWAY. &#34;HE IS, IN MY JUDGMENT, THE FOURTH SMARTEST MAN IN LONDON, AND FOR DARING I AM NOT SURE THAT HE HAS NOT A CLAIM TO BE THIRD. I HAVE KNOWN SOMETHING OF HIM BEFORE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;EVIDENTLY,&#34; SAID I, &#34;MR. WILSON\\&#39;S ASSISTANT COUNTS FOR A GOOD DEAL IN THIS MYSTERY OF THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE. I AM SURE THAT YOU INQUIRED YOUR WAY MERELY IN ORDER THAT YOU MIGHT SEE HIM.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NOT HIM.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHAT THEN?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THE KNEES OF HIS TROUSERS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND WHAT DID YOU SEE?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHAT I EXPECTED TO SEE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHY DID YOU BEAT THE PAVEMENT?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;MY DEAR DOCTOR, THIS IS A TIME FOR OBSERVATION, NOT FOR TALK. WE ARE SPIES IN AN ENEMY\\&#39;S COUNTRY. WE KNOW SOMETHING OF SAXE-COBURG SQUARE. LET US NOW EXPLORE THE PARTS WHICH LIE BEHIND IT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE ROAD IN WHICH WE FOUND OURSELVES AS WE TURNED ROUND THE CORNER FROM THE RETIRED SAXE-COBURG SQUARE PRESENTED AS GREAT A CONTRAST TO IT AS THE FRONT OF A PICTURE DOES TO THE BACK. IT WAS ONE OF THE MAIN ARTERIES WHICH CONVEYED THE TRAFFIC OF THE CITY TO THE NORTH AND WEST. THE ROADWAY WAS BLOCKED WITH THE IMMENSE STREAM OF COMMERCE FLOWING IN A DOUBLE TIDE INWARD AND OUTWARD, WHILE THE FOOTPATHS WERE BLACK WITH THE HURRYING SWARM OF PEDESTRIANS. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO REALISE AS WE LOOKED AT THE LINE OF FINE SHOPS AND STATELY BUSINESS PREMISES THAT THEY REALLY ABUTTED ON THE OTHER SIDE UPON THE FADED AND STAGNANT SQUARE WHICH WE HAD JUST QUITTED.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;LET ME SEE,&#34; SAID HOLMES, STANDING AT THE CORNER AND GLANCING ALONG THE LINE, &#34;I SHOULD LIKE JUST TO REMEMBER THE ORDER OF THE HOUSES HERE. IT IS A HOBBY OF MINE TO HAVE AN EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF LONDON. THERE IS MORTIMER\\&#39;S, THE TOBACCONIST, THE LITTLE NEWSPAPER SHOP, THE COBURG BRANCH OF THE CITY AND SUBURBAN BANK, THE VEGETARIAN RESTAURANT, AND MCFARLANE\\&#39;S CARRIAGE-BUILDING DEPOT. THAT CARRIES US RIGHT ON TO THE OTHER BLOCK. AND NOW, DOCTOR, WE\\&#39;VE DONE OUR WORK, SO IT\\&#39;S TIME WE HAD SOME PLAY. A SANDWICH AND A CUP OF COFFEE, AND THEN OFF TO VIOLIN-LAND, WHERE ALL IS SWEETNESS AND DELICACY AND HARMONY, AND THERE ARE NO RED-HEADED CLIENTS TO VEX US WITH THEIR CONUNDRUMS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;MY FRIEND WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICIAN, BEING HIMSELF NOT ONLY A VERY CAPABLE PERFORMER BUT A COMPOSER OF NO ORDINARY MERIT. ALL THE AFTERNOON HE SAT IN THE STALLS WRAPPED IN THE MOST PERFECT HAPPINESS, GENTLY WAVING HIS LONG, THIN FINGERS IN TIME TO THE MUSIC, WHILE HIS GENTLY SMILING FACE AND HIS LANGUID, DREAMY EYES WERE AS UNLIKE THOSE OF HOLMES THE SLEUTH-HOUND, HOLMES THE RELENTLESS, KEEN-WITTED, READY-HANDED CRIMINAL AGENT, AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE. IN HIS SINGULAR CHARACTER THE DUAL NATURE ALTERNATELY ASSERTED ITSELF, AND HIS EXTREME EXACTNESS AND ASTUTENESS REPRESENTED, AS I HAVE OFTEN THOUGHT, THE REACTION AGAINST THE POETIC AND CONTEMPLATIVE MOOD WHICH OCCASIONALLY PREDOMINATED IN HIM. THE SWING OF HIS NATURE TOOK HIM FROM EXTREME LANGUOR TO DEVOURING ENERGY; AND, AS I KNEW WELL, HE WAS NEVER SO TRULY FORMIDABLE AS WHEN, FOR DAYS ON END, HE HAD BEEN LOUNGING IN HIS ARMCHAIR AMID HIS IMPROVISATIONS AND HIS BLACK-LETTER EDITIONS. THEN IT WAS THAT THE LUST OF THE CHASE WOULD SUDDENLY COME UPON HIM, AND THAT HIS BRILLIANT REASONING POWER WOULD RISE TO THE LEVEL OF INTUITION, UNTIL THOSE WHO WERE UNACQUAINTED WITH HIS METHODS WOULD LOOK ASKANCE AT HIM AS ON A MAN WHOSE KNOWLEDGE WAS NOT THAT OF OTHER MORTALS. WHEN I SAW HIM THAT AFTERNOON SO ENWRAPPED IN THE MUSIC AT ST. JAMES&#39;S HALL I FELT THAT AN EVIL TIME MIGHT BE COMING UPON THOSE WHOM HE HAD SET HIMSELF TO HUNT DOWN.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU WANT TO GO HOME, NO DOUBT, DOCTOR,&#34; HE REMARKED AS WE EMERGED.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YES, IT WOULD BE AS WELL.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND I HAVE SOME BUSINESS TO DO WHICH WILL TAKE SOME HOURS. THIS BUSINESS AT COBURG SQUARE IS SERIOUS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHY SERIOUS?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;A CONSIDERABLE CRIME IS IN CONTEMPLATION. I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT WE SHALL BE IN TIME TO STOP IT. BUT TO-DAY BEING SATURDAY RATHER COMPLICATES MATTERS. I SHALL WANT YOUR HELP TO-NIGHT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AT WHAT TIME?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;TEN WILL BE EARLY ENOUGH.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I SHALL BE AT BAKER STREET AT TEN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;VERY WELL. AND, I SAY, DOCTOR, THERE MAY BE SOME LITTLE DANGER, SO KINDLY PUT YOUR ARMY REVOLVER IN YOUR POCKET.&#34; HE WAVED HIS HAND, TURNED ON HIS HEEL, AND DISAPPEARED IN AN INSTANT AMONG THE CROWD.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;I TRUST THAT I AM NOT MORE DENSE THAN MY NEIGHBOURS, BUT I WAS ALWAYS OPPRESSED WITH A SENSE OF MY OWN STUPIDITY IN MY DEALINGS WITH SHERLOCK HOLMES. HERE I HAD HEARD WHAT HE HAD HEARD, I HAD SEEN WHAT HE HAD SEEN, AND YET FROM HIS WORDS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE SAW CLEARLY NOT ONLY WHAT HAD HAPPENED BUT WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN, WHILE TO ME THE WHOLE BUSINESS WAS STILL CONFUSED AND GROTESQUE. AS I DROVE HOME TO MY HOUSE IN KENSINGTON I THOUGHT OVER IT ALL, FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY STORY OF THE RED-HEADED COPIER OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA DOWN TO THE VISIT TO SAXE-COBURG SQUARE, AND THE OMINOUS WORDS WITH WHICH HE HAD PARTED FROM ME. WHAT WAS THIS NOCTURNAL EXPEDITION, AND WHY SHOULD I GO ARMED? WHERE WERE WE GOING, AND WHAT WERE WE TO DO? I HAD THE HINT FROM HOLMES THAT THIS SMOOTH-FACED PAWNBROKER&#39;S ASSISTANT WAS A FORMIDABLE MAN--A MAN WHO MIGHT PLAY A DEEP GAME. I TRIED TO PUZZLE IT OUT, BUT GAVE IT UP IN DESPAIR AND SET THE MATTER ASIDE UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD BRING AN EXPLANATION.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;IT WAS A QUARTER-PAST NINE WHEN I STARTED FROM HOME AND MADE MY WAY ACROSS THE PARK, AND SO THROUGH OXFORD STREET TO BAKER STREET. TWO HANSOMS WERE STANDING AT THE DOOR, AND AS I ENTERED THE PASSAGE I HEARD THE SOUND OF VOICES FROM ABOVE. ON ENTERING HIS ROOM, I FOUND HOLMES IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION WITH TWO MEN, ONE OF WHOM I RECOGNISED AS PETER JONES, THE OFFICIAL POLICE AGENT, WHILE THE OTHER WAS A LONG, THIN, SAD-FACED MAN, WITH A VERY SHINY HAT AND OPPRESSIVELY RESPECTABLE FROCK-COAT.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;HA! OUR PARTY IS COMPLETE,&#34; SAID HOLMES, BUTTONING UP HIS PEA-JACKET AND TAKING HIS HEAVY HUNTING CROP FROM THE RACK. &#34;WATSON, I THINK YOU KNOW MR. JONES, OF SCOTLAND YARD? LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO MR. MERRYWEATHER, WHO IS TO BE OUR COMPANION IN TO-NIGHT\\&#39;S ADVENTURE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WE\\&#39;RE HUNTING IN COUPLES AGAIN, DOCTOR, YOU SEE,&#34; SAID JONES IN HIS CONSEQUENTIAL WAY. &#34;OUR FRIEND HERE IS A WONDERFUL MAN FOR STARTING A CHASE. ALL HE WANTS IS AN OLD DOG TO HELP HIM TO DO THE RUNNING DOWN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I HOPE A WILD GOOSE MAY NOT PROVE TO BE THE END OF OUR CHASE,&#34; OBSERVED MR. MERRYWEATHER GLOOMILY.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU MAY PLACE CONSIDERABLE CONFIDENCE IN MR. HOLMES, SIR,&#34; SAID THE POLICE AGENT LOFTILY. &#34;HE HAS HIS OWN LITTLE METHODS, WHICH ARE, IF HE WON\\&#39;T MIND MY SAYING SO, JUST A LITTLE TOO THEORETICAL AND FANTASTIC, BUT HE HAS THE MAKINGS OF A DETECTIVE IN HIM. IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT ONCE OR TWICE, AS IN THAT BUSINESS OF THE SHOLTO MURDER AND THE AGRA TREASURE, HE HAS BEEN MORE NEARLY CORRECT THAN THE OFFICIAL FORCE.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;OH, IF YOU SAY SO, MR. JONES, IT IS ALL RIGHT,&#34; SAID THE STRANGER WITH DEFERENCE. &#34;STILL, I CONFESS THAT I MISS MY RUBBER. IT IS THE FIRST SATURDAY NIGHT FOR SEVEN-AND-TWENTY YEARS THAT I HAVE NOT HAD MY RUBBER.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I THINK YOU WILL FIND,&#34; SAID SHERLOCK HOLMES, &#34;THAT YOU WILL PLAY FOR A HIGHER STAKE TO-NIGHT THAN YOU HAVE EVER DONE YET, AND THAT THE PLAY WILL BE MORE EXCITING. FOR YOU, MR. MERRYWEATHER, THE STAKE WILL BE SOME $30,000; AND FOR YOU, JONES, IT WILL BE THE MAN UPON WHOM YOU WISH TO LAY YOUR HANDS.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;JOHN CLAY, THE MURDERER, THIEF, SMASHER, AND FORGER. HE\\&#39;S A YOUNG MAN, MR. MERRYWEATHER, BUT HE IS AT THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION, AND I WOULD RATHER HAVE MY BRACELETS ON HIM THAN ON ANY CRIMINAL IN LONDON. HE\\&#39;S A REMARKABLE MAN, IS YOUNG JOHN CLAY. HIS GRANDFATHER WAS A ROYAL DUKE, AND HE HIMSELF HAS BEEN TO ETON AND OXFORD. HIS BRAIN IS AS CUNNING AS HIS FINGERS, AND THOUGH WE MEET SIGNS OF HIM AT EVERY TURN, WE NEVER KNOW WHERE TO FIND THE MAN HIMSELF. HE\\&#39;LL CRACK A CRIB IN SCOTLAND ONE WEEK, AND BE RAISING MONEY TO BUILD AN ORPHANAGE IN CORNWALL THE NEXT. I\\&#39;VE BEEN ON HIS TRACK FOR YEARS AND HAVE NEVER SET EYES ON HIM YET.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I HOPE THAT I MAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING YOU TO-NIGHT. I\\&#39;VE HAD ONE OR TWO LITTLE TURNS ALSO WITH MR. JOHN CLAY, AND I AGREE WITH YOU THAT HE IS AT THE HEAD OF HIS PROFESSION. IT IS PAST TEN, HOWEVER, AND QUITE TIME THAT WE STARTED. IF YOU TWO WILL TAKE THE FIRST HANSOM, WATSON AND I WILL FOLLOW IN THE SECOND.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;SHERLOCK HOLMES WAS NOT VERY COMMUNICATIVE DURING THE LONG DRIVE AND LAY BACK IN THE CAB HUMMING THE TUNES WHICH HE HAD HEARD IN THE AFTERNOON. WE RATTLED THROUGH AN ENDLESS LABYRINTH OF GAS-LIT STREETS UNTIL WE EMERGED INTO FARRINGTON STREET.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WE ARE CLOSE THERE NOW,&#34; MY FRIEND REMARKED. &#34;THIS FELLOW MERRYWEATHER IS A BANK DIRECTOR, AND PERSONALLY INTERESTED IN THE MATTER. I THOUGHT IT AS WELL TO HAVE JONES WITH US ALSO. HE IS NOT A BAD FELLOW, THOUGH AN ABSOLUTE IMBECILE IN HIS PROFESSION. HE HAS ONE POSITIVE VIRTUE. HE IS AS BRAVE AS A BULLDOG AND AS TENACIOUS AS A LOBSTER IF HE GETS HIS CLAWS UPON ANYONE. HERE WE ARE, AND THEY ARE WAITING FOR US.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;WE HAD REACHED THE SAME CROWDED THOROUGHFARE IN WHICH WE HAD FOUND OURSELVES IN THE MORNING. OUR CABS WERE DISMISSED, AND, FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE OF MR. MERRYWEATHER, WE PASSED DOWN A NARROW PASSAGE AND THROUGH A SIDE DOOR, WHICH HE OPENED FOR US. WITHIN THERE WAS A SMALL CORRIDOR, WHICH ENDED IN A VERY MASSIVE IRON GATE. THIS ALSO WAS OPENED, AND LED DOWN A FLIGHT OF WINDING STONE STEPS, WHICH TERMINATED AT ANOTHER FORMIDABLE GATE. MR. MERRYWEATHER STOPPED TO LIGHT A LANTERN, AND THEN CONDUCTED US DOWN A DARK, EARTH-SMELLING PASSAGE, AND SO, AFTER OPENING A THIRD DOOR, INTO A HUGE VAULT OR CELLAR, WHICH WAS PILED ALL ROUND WITH CRATES AND MASSIVE BOXES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOU ARE NOT VERY VULNERABLE FROM ABOVE,&#34; HOLMES REMARKED AS HE HELD UP THE LANTERN AND GAZED ABOUT HIM.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;NOR FROM BELOW,&#34; SAID MR. MERRYWEATHER, STRIKING HIS STICK UPON THE FLAGS WHICH LINED THE FLOOR. &#34;WHY, DEAR ME, IT SOUNDS QUITE HOLLOW!&#34; HE REMARKED, LOOKING UP IN SURPRISE.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I MUST REALLY ASK YOU TO BE A LITTLE MORE QUIET!&#34; SAID HOLMES SEVERELY. &#34;YOU HAVE ALREADY IMPERILLED THE WHOLE SUCCESS OF OUR EXPEDITION. MIGHT I BEG THAT YOU WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SIT DOWN UPON ONE OF THOSE BOXES, AND NOT TO INTERFERE?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;THE SOLEMN MR. MERRYWEATHER PERCHED HIMSELF UPON A CRATE, WITH A VERY INJURED EXPRESSION UPON HIS FACE, WHILE HOLMES FELL UPON HIS KNEES UPON THE FLOOR AND, WITH THE LANTERN AND A MAGNIFYING LENS, BEGAN TO EXAMINE MINUTELY THE CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES. A FEW SECONDS SUFFICED TO SATISFY HIM, FOR HE SPRANG TO HIS FEET AGAIN AND PUT HIS GLASS IN HIS POCKET.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WE HAVE AT LEAST AN HOUR BEFORE US,&#34; HE REMARKED, &#34;FOR THEY CAN HARDLY TAKE ANY STEPS UNTIL THE GOOD PAWNBROKER IS SAFELY IN BED. THEN THEY WILL NOT LOSE A MINUTE, FOR THE SOONER THEY DO THEIR WORK THE LONGER TIME THEY WILL HAVE FOR THEIR ESCAPE. WE ARE AT PRESENT, DOCTOR--AS NO DOUBT YOU HAVE DIVINED--IN THE CELLAR OF THE CITY BRANCH OF ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL LONDON BANKS. MR. MERRYWEATHER IS THE CHAIRMAN OF DIRECTORS, AND HE WILL EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT THERE ARE REASONS WHY THE MORE DARING CRIMINALS OF LONDON SHOULD TAKE A CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THIS CELLAR AT PRESENT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT IS OUR FRENCH GOLD,&#34; WHISPERED THE DIRECTOR. &#34;WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL WARNINGS THAT AN ATTEMPT MIGHT BE MADE UPON IT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YOUR FRENCH GOLD?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;YES. WE HAD OCCASION SOME MONTHS AGO TO STRENGTHEN OUR RESOURCES AND BORROWED FOR THAT PURPOSE 30,000 NAPOLEONS FROM THE BANK OF FRANCE. IT HAS BECOME KNOWN THAT WE HAVE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO UNPACK THE MONEY, AND THAT IT IS STILL LYING IN OUR CELLAR. THE CRATE UPON WHICH I SIT CONTAINS 2,000 NAPOLEONS PACKED BETWEEN LAYERS OF LEAD FOIL. OUR RESERVE OF BULLION IS MUCH LARGER AT PRESENT THAN IS USUALLY KEPT IN A SINGLE BRANCH OFFICE, AND THE DIRECTORS HAVE HAD MISGIVINGS UPON THE SUBJECT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;WHICH WERE VERY WELL JUSTIFIED,&#34; OBSERVED HOLMES. &#34;AND NOW IT IS TIME THAT WE ARRANGED OUR LITTLE PLANS. I EXPECT THAT WITHIN AN HOUR MATTERS WILL COME TO A HEAD. IN THE MEANTIME MR. MERRYWEATHER, WE MUST PUT THE SCREEN OVER THAT DARK LANTERN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;AND SIT IN THE DARK?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I AM AFRAID SO. I HAD BROUGHT A PACK OF CARDS IN MY POCKET, AND I THOUGHT THAT, AS WE WERE A PARTIE CARREE, YOU MIGHT HAVE YOUR RUBBER AFTER ALL. BUT I SEE THAT THE ENEMY\\&#39;S PREPARATIONS HAVE GONE SO FAR THAT WE CANNOT RISK THE PRESENCE OF A LIGHT. AND, FIRST OF ALL, WE MUST CHOOSE OUR POSITIONS. THESE ARE DARING MEN, AND THOUGH WE SHALL TAKE THEM AT A DISADVANTAGE, THEY MAY DO US SOME HARM UNLESS WE ARE CAREFUL. I SHALL STAND BEHIND THIS CRATE, AND DO YOU CONCEAL YOURSELVES BEHIND THOSE. THEN, WHEN I FLASH A LIGHT UPON THEM, CLOSE IN SWIFTLY. IF THEY FIRE, WATSON, HAVE NO COMPUNCTION ABOUT SHOOTING THEM DOWN.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;I PLACED MY REVOLVER, COCKED, UPON THE TOP OF THE WOODEN CASE BEHIND WHICH I CROUCHED. HOLMES SHOT THE SLIDE ACROSS THE FRONT OF HIS LANTERN AND LEFT US IN PITCH DARKNESS--SUCH AN ABSOLUTE DARKNESS AS I HAVE NEVER BEFORE EXPERIENCED. THE SMELL OF HOT METAL REMAINED TO ASSURE US THAT THE LIGHT WAS STILL THERE, READY TO FLASH OUT AT A MOMENT&#39;S NOTICE. TO ME, WITH MY NERVES WORKED UP TO A PITCH OF EXPECTANCY, THERE WAS SOMETHING DEPRESSING AND SUBDUING IN THE SUDDEN GLOOM, AND IN THE COLD DANK AIR OF THE VAULT.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEY HAVE BUT ONE RETREAT,&#34; WHISPERED HOLMES. &#34;THAT IS BACK THROUGH THE HOUSE INTO SAXE-COBURG SQUARE. I HOPE THAT YOU HAVE DONE WHAT I ASKED YOU, JONES?&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;I HAVE AN INSPECTOR AND TWO OFFICERS WAITING AT THE FRONT DOOR.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;THEN WE HAVE STOPPED ALL THE HOLES. AND NOW WE MUST BE SILENT AND WAIT.&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;WHAT A TIME IT SEEMED! FROM COMPARING NOTES AFTERWARDS IT WAS BUT AN HOUR AND A QUARTER, YET IT APPEARED TO ME THAT THE NIGHT MUST HAVE ALMOST GONE, AND THE DAWN BE BREAKING ABOVE US. MY LIMBS WERE WEARY AND STIFF, FOR I FEARED TO CHANGE MY POSITION; YET MY NERVES WERE WORKED UP TO THE HIGHEST PITCH OF TENSION, AND MY HEARING WAS SO ACUTE THAT I COULD NOT ONLY HEAR THE GENTLE BREATHING OF MY COMPANIONS, BUT I COULD DISTINGUISH THE DEEPER, HEAVIER IN-BREATH OF THE BULKY JONES FROM THE THIN, SIGHING NOTE OF THE BANK DIRECTOR. FROM MY POSITION I COULD LOOK OVER THE CASE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FLOOR. SUDDENLY MY EYES CAUGHT THE GLINT OF A LIGHT.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;AT FIRST IT WAS BUT A LURID SPARK UPON THE STONE PAVEMENT. THEN IT LENGTHENED OUT UNTIL IT BECAME A YELLOW LINE, AND THEN, WITHOUT ANY WARNING OR SOUND, A GASH SEEMED TO OPEN AND A HAND APPEARED, A WHITE, ALMOST WOMANLY HAND, WHICH FELT ABOUT IN THE CENTRE OF THE LITTLE AREA OF LIGHT. FOR A MINUTE OR MORE THE HAND, WITH ITS WRITHING FINGERS, PROTRUDED OUT OF THE FLOOR. THEN IT WAS WITHDRAWN AS SUDDENLY AS IT APPEARED, AND ALL WAS DARK AGAIN SAVE THE SINGLE LURID SPARK WHICH MARKED A CHINK BETWEEN THE STONES.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;ITS DISAPPEARANCE, HOWEVER, WAS BUT MOMENTARY. WITH A RENDING, TEARING SOUND, ONE OF THE BROAD, WHITE STONES TURNED OVER UPON ITS SIDE AND LEFT A SQUARE, GAPING HOLE, THROUGH WHICH STREAMED THE LIGHT OF A LANTERN. OVER THE EDGE THERE PEEPED A CLEAN-CUT, BOYISH FACE, WHICH LOOKED KEENLY ABOUT IT, AND THEN, WITH A HAND ON EITHER SIDE OF THE APERTURE, DREW ITSELF SHOULDER-HIGH AND WAIST-HIGH, UNTIL ONE KNEE RESTED UPON THE EDGE. IN ANOTHER INSTANT HE STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE HOLE AND WAS HAULING AFTER HIM A COMPANION, LITHE AND SMALL LIKE HIMSELF, WITH A PALE FACE AND A SHOCK OF VERY RED HAIR.&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT\\&#39;S ALL CLEAR,&#34; HE WHISPERED. &#34;HAVE YOU THE CHISEL AND THE BAGS? GREAT SCOTT! JUMP, ARCHIE, JUMP, AND I\\&#39;LL SWING FOR IT!&#34;&#39;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#34;SHERLOCK HOLMES HAD SPRUNG OUT AND SEIZED THE INTRUDER BY THE COLLAR. THE OTHER DIVED DOWN THE HOLE, AND I HEARD THE SOUND OF RENDING CLOTH AS JONES CLUTCHED AT HIS SKIRTS. THE LIGHT FLASHED UPON THE BARREL OF A REVOLVER, BUT HOLMES&#39; HUNTING CROP CAME DOWN ON THE MAN&#39;S WRIST, AND THE PISTOL CLINKED UPON THE STONE FLOOR.&#34;,\n &#39;&#39;,\n &#39;&#34;IT\\&#39;S NO USE, JOHN CLAY,&#34; SAID HOLMES BLANDLY. &#34;YOU HAVE NO CHANCE AT ALL.&#34;&#39;,\n
